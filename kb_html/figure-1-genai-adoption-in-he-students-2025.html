    <h1>Figure 1 — Proposed Research Model (Explanation)</h1>
    <p class="muted">The diagram groups three information–quality constructs inside <strong>Perceived Information Quality (PIQ)</strong> and connects them through <em>Frequency</em> to <em>Behavioural Intention</em> and ultimately to <em>Artificial Intelligence Use</em>.</p>

    <h2>At a glance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Credibility</strong>, <strong>Reliability</strong> and <strong>Importance</strong> (PIQ) each have a <em>direct positive effect</em> on <strong>Frequency</strong> of student interactions with GenAI.</li>
      <li><strong>Frequency</strong> has a <em>direct positive effect</em> on <strong>Behavioural Intention</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Behavioural Intention</strong> has a <em>direct positive effect</em> on <strong>Artificial Intelligence Use</strong> (actual usage).</li>
      <li>Thus, <em>Frequency</em> mediates the influence of PIQ on intention, and <em>Behavioural Intention</em> mediates the path to actual use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Constructs</h2>

    <h2>Implied hypotheses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>H1–H3:</strong> Credibility, Reliability, and Importance each positively predict <em>Frequency</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>H4:</strong> <em>Frequency</em> positively predicts <em>Behavioural Intention</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>H5:</strong> <em>Behavioural Intention</em> positively predicts <em>AI Use</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Mediation:</strong> (Credibility/Reliability/Importance) → Frequency → Intention → AI Use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why this differs from classic TAM</h2>
    <p>The model reframes TAM by replacing <em>Perceived Ease of Use</em> and <em>Perceived Usefulness</em> with PIQ dimensions more specific to GenAI content quality (credibility, reliability, importance), making <em>usage frequency</em> the proximal driver of intention.</p>

    <h2>How to read the original diagram</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Start at the left: the three PIQ boxes sit inside a dashed container labelled “Perceived Information Quality (PIQ)”.</li>
      <li>Each PIQ box points to <strong>Frequency</strong> (three arrows converging).</li>
      <li><strong>Frequency</strong> points to <strong>Behavioural Intention</strong>, which points to <strong>Artificial Intelligence Use</strong>.</li>
      <li>Arrowheads imply direction and positive influence; no feedback loops are drawn.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Measurement suggestions (examples)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Credibility/Reliability/Importance: 3–5 Likert items per construct (validated PIQ scales).</li>
      <li>Frequency: self-reported weekly use or platform logs.</li>
      <li>Intention: standard BI items (e.g., “I intend to use GenAI next term…”).</li>
      <li>AI Use: observed usage counts or task-level adoption metrics.</li>
    </ul>
