    <p>Transport is a clear winner from the Spending Review and it is positive to see the government follow through on the promised injection following the cancellation of parts of HS2 and other transport projects in the Autumn budget. Capital spending (excluding HS2) is set to rise in real terms by 3.9% annually to between 2026-30 – the third highest increase of any department, behind Defence and Business &amp; Trade. The capital budget for HS2 between 2026-30 is £25bn, thought this represents an average annual real terms decline of 7.9%.</p>

<p>As expected, £15.6bn of funding to 2032 was committed for the elected mayors of some of England's largest city regions via the Transport for City Regions settlements, supporting them to invest in their local transport priorities. This will be spent on tram, train and bus projects across the Midlands, the North and the West Country, including a new line between Manchester and Liverpool.</p>
<p>Other announcements include £3.5bn to drive delivery of the TransPennine Upgrade and £2.5bn for East-West Rail, both of which were approved in the Autumn budget. The government also reiterated its support for the expansion of Heathrow to include a third runway and has launched a consultation on Ports, which could bring opportunities in Civils.</p>
