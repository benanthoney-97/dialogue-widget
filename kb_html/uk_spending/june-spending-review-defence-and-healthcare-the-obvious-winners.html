    <p>The IFS believed that allocations ultimately hinged on plans for Healthcare and Defence. At an online event on the 6<sup>th</sup> of June (see here), it summarised the questions facing the government as follows:</p>
<p>1.) How much to spend on Healthcare?</p>
<p>2.) How fast, and how far, to increase Defence spending?</p>
<p>3.) What to squeeze – and how?</p>

                                   12 June 2025</p>
<p>4.) More public investment, and in what?</p>
<p>Regarding Healthcare, as expected, the resource budget was increased by £29bn to 2028, while the £14bn capital budget was held flat in real terms to 2029. The government committed to spending 2.6% of GDP on Defence by 2027, while a precise timeline to 3% was still not given. Areas squeezed include Justice, the Home Office and the Foreign Office, while more investment was committed to Defence, Transport (ex HS2), Energy (ex Sizewell C) and Education.</p>

<p>The plans for investment in long-term projects – including roads, hospitals, social housing and other infrastructure – are significantly more generous than the ones set out by the previous government.</p>
