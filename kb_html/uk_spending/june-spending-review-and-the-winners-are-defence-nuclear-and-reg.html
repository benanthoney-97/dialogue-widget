<p>The spending review was not a fiscal event, as the spending envelope was set. But the detail was nonetheless interesting – for some. Given budget constraints and planned spending on Defence, winners and losers were inevitable. However, our coverage is firmly in the winner's camp, particularly companies with exposure to Defence, Transport, Nuclear Energy and Affordable Housing. Key players in these markets include <strong>Balfour Beatty, Costain, Galliford Try, Kier, Morgan Sindall and Severfield</strong>. Energy capital budgets have been bolstered further, despite increasing 22% in the Autumn budget, and the government has shown a firm commitment to Nuclear. Transport was given the third highest capital spending boost and £15.6bn of funding has been allocated for projects in the North and Midlands. The government committed £39bn for Affordable Housing – the largest cash injection in over 50 years. The annual capital budget for Schools will increase 1.3% to 2030, while Prisons were left without additional funding. The government aims to end using hotels for asylum seekers by 2029 but this is easier said than done. And don't forget the importance of regulatory spend – namely Energy and Water – which has little to do with government budgets.</p>
<p><strong>Given planned spending on Defence, winners and losers were inevitable</strong></p>
<p>The June Spending Review has outlined departmental resource budgets from 2026-29 and capital budgets from 2026-30. The government will publish the 10-year Infrastructure Strategy Later in June. Total spending 'envelopes' were already known, including £113bn of investment to 2030. Over the respective spending review periods, resource spending will on average rise by 1.2% annually, while capital spending will rise by 1.3%, which much of that front-loaded.</p>
