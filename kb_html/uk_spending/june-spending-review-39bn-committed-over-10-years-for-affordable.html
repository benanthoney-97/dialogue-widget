<p>A shortage of housing, in particular social housing, is a growing problem in the UK. Social housing waiting lists are at the highest level in a decade, at c.1.3m in 2024, and annual completions remain low in a historical context.</p>

<p>To address the problem, Angela Rayner has repeatedly promised "the biggest boost to social and affordable housing in a generation", with the government aiming to build 1.5m homes by the end of this parliament. Accordingly, an additional £500m of funding was allocated through the Affordable Homes</p>

<p>PANMURE LIBERUM                    June Spending Review
                                   12 June 2025</p>
<p>Programme in the Autumn Budget, followed by a further £2bn across the parliamentary term in the March Spring Statement. The OBR now expects over 305,000 housing completions by 2029, noting that without Labour's additional funding and planning reforms, that figure would drop to 238,000.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government was one of the last departments to finalise a funding package, with Angela Rayner fighting against significant cuts. Rachel Reeves was thought to be considering a long-term funding settlement of up to £25bn for Social Housing, to be disbursed over 10 years. In addition, she was expected to announce plans for a "housing bank" that would enable Homes England to more easily deliver cheap financing to housebuilders.</p>
<p><strong>Announcements</strong></p>
<p>The government has committed £39bn over 10 years to the new Affordable Homes programme, higher than the previously reported £25bn and representing the biggest cash injection into social housing in 50 years. The commitment includes plans to almost double annual investment in Affordable Homes to £4 billion by 2029-30, compared to £2.3bn between 2021 and 2026. The money will go to local authorities, private developers and housing associations.</p>
<p>The government confirmed Homes England will be designated a public financial institution, with an additional £10bn made available for financial investment, in line with pre-announced plans for a "housing bank". In addition, the government confirmed £1bn of new investment between 2026-27 and 2029- 30 to accelerate the remediation of social housing, by giving social housing providers equal access to government funding as private building owners.</p>
<p>The social housing sector will also benefit from a 10-year rent settlement that allows landlords to raise rents by 1% above inflation, giving social housing providers confidence to build and long-term clarity over revenues.</p>
<p><strong>Winners and losers</strong></p>
<p>In our coverage, the key exposure to affordable housing is at <strong>Galliford</strong>, <strong>Kier</strong> and <strong>Morgan Sindall</strong>. <strong>Speedy Hire</strong> is also exposed to the wider residential construction market.</p>
