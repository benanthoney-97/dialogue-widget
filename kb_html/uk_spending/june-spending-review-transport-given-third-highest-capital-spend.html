<p>We view Transport as one of the softer sectors, given inflation, cost overruns and the cost of HS2. In the Autumn Budget, Rachel Reeves cancelled £1.3bn</p>

<p>12 June 2025</p>
<p>worth of National Highway projects and the Department for Transport's interim settlement – filling the one-year gap between RIS2 and RIS3 – highlighted both a decline in total funding and a shift from capital to maintenance spending, to which our Constructor coverage has limited exposure. Spending plans for Rail are also discouraging, with CP7 spend expected to remain virtually flat to 2029 in nominal terms, and CP7 has been fraught with delays.</p>
<p>The Autumn Budget brought positive news for HS2 – Rachel Reeves confirmed that funding would be provided for tunnelling work at Euston Station – but the project has since suffered delays. Delivery of works at the Euston station end of HS2's tunnel between west and central London have been rescheduled, as reported by Construction News in February 2025. And in May 2025, New Civil Engineer reported that HS2's completion date is expected in 2036 at the earlier, with 2039 more likely.</p>
<p>Announcements expected in the Spending Review included detail on a pre-announced £15bn investment for Transport projects in the North and Midlands, funding for the Lower Thames Crossing, and plans for RIS3.</p>
