    <p>Despite talk of possible cuts, the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (excluding Sizewell C) will see its annual capital budget rise 2.6% in real terms to 2030. Resource budgets will remain broadly flat, rising only 0.5%.</p>

<p>As expected, £11.5bn of new state funding was committed for Sizewell C, taking the total taxpayer investment to £17.0bn. Rachel Reeves also promised £14.2bn of taxpayer funding over the current parliament, including the £2.7bn commitment made in the Autumn Budget.</p>
<p>The Sizewell announcement is consistent with the government's specific commitment to Nuclear, large scale reactors and Small Modular Reactors, which we wrote about in our twice-yearly piece on page 62, here. However, Sizewell is still not fully funded. The UK government and EDF are seeking financial commitments from several other investors (e.g. pension funds) before they can sign off a "final investment decision", expected next month</p>

<p>PANMURE LIBERUM                                June Spending Review
                                              12 June 2025</p>
<p>during an Anglo-French summit in London. To give a sense of the likely cost, Hinkley is estimated to cost £42bn, up from £18bn predicted in 2017, and Sizewell will likely take ten years to build. While there are likely to be some learnings, there is also inflation. In order to benefit from the learnings on Hinkley, we expect that the supply chain on Sizewell C would be similar, and some, like <strong>Balfours</strong>, have argued that they would expect to win a greater share of Sizewell. It will help the industry stay utilised as Hinkley approaches completion in perhaps 2031.</p>
<p>The government also pledged £2.5bn for Small Modular Reactors over the Spending Review period (2026-30), as well as a £2.5bn investment in nuclear. Together with the Sizewell C, this means the government has committed £30bn to Nuclear Energy projects over the parliamentary period.</p>
<p>On Carbon Capture, the government announced that in addition to over £20bn promised for Merseyside and Teesside, it would provide further financial support for the Acorn plant in Aberdeenshire and the Viking project in Humberside.</p>
<p>A new power station in Suffolk was not announced.</p>
<p>To 2030, the government is providing £13.2bn of funding for the Warm Homes plan. The £6.6bn pledge for insulation and decarbonisation was not mentioned specifically, but the government said it would "fulfil its manifesto commitment to insulate millions of homes across the country through the "Warm Homes" programme", suggesting it would not be diluted.</p>
