    <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Underinvestment in schools has led to tired infrastructure. The National Audit Office estimated that around 34% of school buildings are beyond their estimated useful life, and the Department for Education quantify the overall backlog for capital investment at £13.8bn.</p>
<p>The Autumn budget went some way to addressing the problem. An additional £6.7bn was allocated for investment in schools for 2026, a 19% increase on 2025. This includes £1.4bn earmarked for rebuilding over 500 schools – a £550m increase on 2024 – and £2.1bn for maintenance.</p>
