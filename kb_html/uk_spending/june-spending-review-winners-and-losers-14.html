    <p>UK listed beneficiaries of the news yesterday on Sizewell include <strong>Babcock</strong>, <strong>Balfour Beatty</strong>, <strong>Costain</strong> and <strong>Kier</strong>. <strong>Costain</strong> should also benefit from investment in clean energy generally.</p>
<p>Sizewell C is a particularly large opportunity for <strong>Balfour Beatty</strong>. Management also sees an opportunity in Small Modular Reactors with Rolls-Royce given their previous experience in Nuclear, but expects competitive bidding in the medium-term.</p>
<p><strong>Severfield</strong> is exposed to the wider energy transition theme. Management is already seeing an increased volume of opportunities in areas such as onshore and offshore wind, solar, carbon capture, hydrogen production and new nuclear, including Sizewell C, small nuclear reactors and fusion energy.</p>
<p>The commitment to the Warm Homes programme is positive for <strong>Eneraqua</strong>, but management is awaiting further details to understand how it may impact. Management is also awaiting detail on the Planning and Infrastructure bill currently going through parliament (see here), which may affect the company's nutrient neutrality solution.</p>
