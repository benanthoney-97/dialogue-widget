    <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Pressure from the Trump administration to reduce US dependence and wars in Ukraine and Gaza have increased the imperative for Defence spending globally, including in the UK. In February 2025, Starmer announced plans to increase UK defence spending by £6.7bn to 2027, finally charting a path to 2.5% of GDP. The commitment to 2.5% GDP in 2027, and 3.0% in the next parliament, was repeated in the Defence Review in June.</p>
<p>Nato leaders are meeting at a summit over 24-25 June and are expected to agree to Trump's demand to increase core Defence spending to 3.5% of GDP, along with a further 1.5% on Defence-related infrastructure, at some point.</p>

                                   12 June 2025</p>
<h1 id="announcements">Announcements</h1>
<p>In the Spending Review, the government committed to spending 2.6% of GDP on Defence by 2027, higher than the previously announced 2.5%, while a precise timeline to 3% was still not given. The Defence capital budget is set to rise by 7.3% per year (in real terms) between 2026-30, the highest of any department, reaching £31.5bn in 2030. The capital budget will be spent on infrastructure projects, such as Defence Estate Optimisation.</p>

<p>The government also gave further details on the £6bn of investments in munitions announced in the Strategic Defence Review, with £4.5bn to be invested in munitions made in British factories.</p>
<h1 id="winners-and-losers">Winners and losers</h1>
<p><strong>Serco</strong> is positively exposed to Defence resource spending in the UK, while <strong>Costain</strong>, <strong>Galliford Try</strong>, <strong>Kier</strong> and <strong>Morgan Sindall</strong> should benefit from investment in Defence infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Balfour Beatty</strong> is also positively exposed – previous work on defence infrastructure, high-security environments and civil nuclear means the company is well placed to match the government's objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Severfield</strong> also stands to benefit from greater investment in Defence infrastructure and national security. The majority of munitions factories, for example, are likely to be designed in steel.</p>
