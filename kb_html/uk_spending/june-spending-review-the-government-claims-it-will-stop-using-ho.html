<p>In the Spending Review, the government claimed it would end hotels being used to house asylum seekers by 2029, with plans to cut asylum spending by £1bn a year to 2029. To this end, £200m of transformation funding was committed to accelerate the transformation of the asylum seekers. The government's claim is consistent with a decline in the forecast resource budget for Asylum to 2029.</p>

<p>However, removing asylum seekers from hotels is easier said than done. The number of asylum seekers being held in hotels remains elevated at 34,644 in Q1 25, despite an improvement in processing, and waiting lists continue to trend upward (see p77-78). Additionally, the cumulative number of English Channel crossings YTD is significantly higher than any of the previous six years, at c.15k at the end of May versus c.10k in 2024 and less than 1k in 2018.</p>
