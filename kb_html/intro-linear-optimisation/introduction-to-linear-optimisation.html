<p>Managers' responsibility:
To make strategic, tactical, or operational decisions.</p>
<p>• <strong>Strategic decisions:</strong>
  Involve higher-level issues concerned with the overall direction of the organization.
  Define the organization's overall goals and aspirations for the future.</p>
<p>• <strong>Tactical decisions:</strong>
  Concern how the organization should achieve the goals and objectives set by its strategy.
  Are usually the responsibility of midlevel management.</p>
<p>• <strong>Operational decisions:</strong>
  Affect how the firm is run from day to day.
  Are the domain of operations managers, who are the closest to the customer.</p>

<h1 id="modelling-vs-models">Modelling VS Models</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This unit stresses <strong>modelling</strong>, not models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning specific <strong>models</strong> is essentially a memorization process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Modelling</strong> is a process where you abstract the essence of a real problem into a model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Successful modelers</strong> treat each problem on its own merits and model it appropriately, using all the logical, analytical, and spreadsheet skills they have.</p>
</li>

<p>Houston, we have a problem</p>
<h2 id="step-1-problem-definition">Step 1: Problem Definition</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Typically, a management science model is initiated when an organization believes it has a <strong>problem</strong> and calls in the analyst to <strong>solve it</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In such cases, the problem has probably already been <strong>defined</strong> by the client, and the client hires the analyst to solve this problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The task of the analyst is to do some <strong>investigation</strong> before accepting the client's claim that the problem has been properly defined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Defining the problem</strong> includes specifying the <strong>organization's objectives</strong> and the parts of the organization that must be studied before the problem can be solved.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-data-collection">Step 2: Data Collection</h2>
<p>• After defining the problem, the analyst collects data to estimate the <strong>value of parameters</strong> that affect the organization's problem.</p>
<p>• All organizations keep track of various data on their operations, but the data are often not in the form the analyst requires.</p>
<p>• One of the analyst's first jobs is to gather exactly the <strong>right data</strong> and put the data into an <strong>appropriate</strong> and <strong>consistent format</strong> for use in the model.</p>

<p>Step 3: <strong>Model Development</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After defining the client's problem and gathering the necessary data, the analyst must develop a model of the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Models are representations of real objects or situations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three forms of models are:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>✔ <strong>Iconic models</strong> - physical replicas of real objects</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Analog models</strong> - physical in form, but do not physically resemble the object being modeled</p>
<p>✔ <strong>Mathematical models</strong> - represent real world problems through a system of mathematical formulas and expressions based on key assumptions, estimates, or statistical analyses (e.g., deterministic optimization models, simulation models)</p>

<h1 id="the-7-step-modelling-process-iv">The 7-Step Modelling Process (IV)</h1>
<h2 id="step-3-model-development-cont">Step 3: <strong>Model Development</strong> (cont.)</h2>
<p>Several properties are desirable for a <strong>good model</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It should represent the client's real problem <strong>accurately</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the model ignores an important constraint, such as an upper bound on capacity, its recommendations might not be possible to <strong>implement</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a model ignores uncertainty when uncertainty is a key aspect of the problem, its findings won't be very <strong>believable</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A good model should achieve the <strong>right balance</strong> between being too simple and too complex.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step-4-model-verification">Step 4: Model Verification</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The analyst now tries to determine whether the model developed in the previous step is an <strong>accurate representation</strong> of reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The model must pass "<strong>plausibility checks</strong>". In this case, various input values and decision variable values are entered into the model to see whether the resulting outputs are plausible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the model's outputs are <strong>not</strong> as expected, then the model is a poor approximation of the actual situation, or the model is fine, but the analyst's intuition is faulty.</p>

<h2 id="step-5-optimisation-decision-making">Step 5: Optimisation &amp; Decision Making</h2>
<p>Optimise</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To use the model to recommend decisions or strategies, the model has to optimize an objective, such as maximize profit or minimize cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The optimization phase is typically the most difficult phase from a mathematical standpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several solution algorithms are available to solve real problems (e.g., simplex algorithm, branch-and-bound).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the problem is too complex, a heuristic is used to solve it. Heuristic is guided by common sense, intuition, and trial-and-error.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="step-6-model-communication-to-management">Step 6: Model Communication to Management</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The analyst must eventually communicate a model and its recommendations to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A large gap typically exists between management science analysts and the managers of organizations. Managers know their business, but they often do not understand much about mathematical models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best strategy for a successful presentation is to involve key people in the organization, including top executives, in the project from the beginning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The analyst should also try to make the model as intuitive and user-friendly as possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step-7-model-implementation">Step 7: Model Implementation</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the organization has accepted the <strong>validity</strong> and <strong>usefulness</strong> of the study, the analyst then helps to implement its recommendations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The implemented system must be monitored <strong>constantly</strong> (and updated <strong>dynamically</strong> as the environment changes) to ensure that the model enables the organization to <strong>meet its objectives</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A useful model, once implemented, is likely to be <strong>expanded</strong> by the organization.</p>
