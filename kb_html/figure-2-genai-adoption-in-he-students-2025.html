    <h1>Figure 2 — PIQ → Frequency → Intention → AI Use</h1>
    <p class="muted">This figure presents the <strong>estimated path coefficients</strong> for the model linking <em>Perceived Information Quality (PIQ)</em> to <em>Behavioural Intention</em> and <em>Artificial Intelligence Use</em>, with <em>Frequency</em> acting as a key mediator.</p>

    <h2>Model summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PIQ constructs</strong> (Credibility, Reliability, Importance) predict <strong>Frequency</strong> of GenAI interactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Frequency</strong> predicts <strong>Behavioural Intention</strong> to use GenAI.</li>
      <li><strong>Behavioural Intention</strong> predicts actual <strong>AI Use</strong>.</li>
      <li>Some <strong>direct paths</strong> from PIQ → Intention are shown; verify sign/significance with the text.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reported coefficients (as shown in the figure)</h2>

    <p class="note">Note: Coefficients are read visually from the figure you shared. If the article’s results table lists signs or significance (e.g., p-values, CIs), use those authoritative values to update this summary.</p>

    <h2>Implications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Importance</strong> appears to be the strongest PIQ driver of <em>Frequency</em>, followed by <strong>Credibility</strong>; <strong>Reliability</strong> is weaker.</li>
      <li>The <strong>Frequency → Intention</strong> link (.36) supports the idea that hands-on engagement is a key route to adoption.</li>
      <li>Behavioural Intention meaningfully predicts <strong>actual use</strong> (.35), consistent with adoption theories.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to narrate this figure</h2>
    <p>“Students who judge GenAI information as <strong>important</strong> and <strong>credible</strong> tend to use it more frequently. That <strong>frequency</strong> raises their <strong>intention</strong> to keep using it, which then translates into <strong>actual usage</strong>. Direct paths from PIQ to intention are present but appear smaller; full stats should be confirmed in the results table.”</p>

    <h3>Checks before publishing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Verify the exact <em>sign</em> (+/–) and <em>significance</em> for PIQ → Intention paths in the paper.</li>
      <li>If you report standardized coefficients, label them as such (β).</li>
      <li>Include sample size, model fit indices (e.g., CFI, RMSEA) if available.</li>
