Keller delivered H1 25 FD EPS 13% ahead of our estimate. We maintained revenue and EBIT estimates, but the new buyback and lower tax drove a 5.8% FD EPS upgrade in FY 26. We make four key points: 1.) The macro environment is challenging but showing signs of improvement and long-term drivers remain supportive; 2.) Despite the challenging macro, the H1 25 order book was broadly flat on the FY 24 level of £1.6bn; 3.) Medium-term guidance for divisional margins implies 269.0p of FD EPS, 15.2% upside to our FY 27 estimate; and 4.) The healthy balance sheet provides scope for acquisitions, which we estimate could be 25% accretive to FD EPS in FY 27, assuming leverage is taken to the middle of the target range. A CY 26 P/E of 6.0x represents a material discount to peers; maintain BUY and TP of 2040p.

### Contextual Summary
The company maintains a stable **market cap (£962m)** across 2024–2027, while **net debt transitions into net cash** by 2027. As a result, **enterprise value (EV) declines steadily** from £1,104m in 2024 to £867m in 2027.  
Valuation multiples suggest **attractive de-leveraging and improving cash generation**, with **P/E falling from 6.8x to 5.8x**, **dividend yield rising from 3.7% to 4.3%**, and **FCF yield consistently strong (11–16%)**. Lower EV/EBITDA and EV/EBIT multiples indicate improved efficiency and cheaper valuation relative to earnings.  
"""

### Key points
H1 25 FD EPS fell 5% to 98.1p but was 13% ahead of our estimate. Underlying EBIT fell 9% to £91.2m. Net debt (excl. leases) increased from £30m in FY 24 to £61.5m.

### Value drivers
Potential 25% accretion from M&A. Long-term structural drivers. Potential margin upside in North America and EME. Support from buybacks.

### What market misses
Track record of cautious guidance. High level of provisioning suggests a cautious approach. Long-term opportunity in Ukraine. >£100m FCFe per annum.

### Is there value?
Keller has de-rated significantly. CY 26 P/E of 6.0x, a discount to construction and consultant peers. TP of 2040p based on SOTP.

# Company dashboard

## What it does
Keller is a market leader in ground engineering - a small niche sub-sector of construction. It has operations in c. 40 countries around the world with the US representing the largest single market. Typical contracts are small and of short duration and represent only 1% of total build costs.

## Bull case
High margin due to value add
High design and engineering content
Growth ahead of construction demand
Global leadership position in niche
Financially strong with asset backing
Manufactures own equipment in some areas

## Bear case
High fixed and working capital
Suncoast profits have been volatile
Potential for large contract losses
Risk of poor acquisitions, like Canada
History of exceptionals
Risk of cyclical downturn in markets, esp. US
High P&L operational gearing

## Geographic split of revenues

## Key risks to our thesis

* Keller's earnings are reliant on the performance of the North American business (77% of FY 25E group EBIT excluding central costs). We assume the North American EBIT margin decreases from 10.6% in FY 24 to 9.1% in FY 25, largely reflecting macro weakness. Further deterioration in the US macro environment could create a material drag on Group profits.
* Similarly, geographical issues or problematic contracts could lead to negative surprises.

## What is priced in and do we differ?

* Long-term drivers remain supportive for Keller. We see a shift in the mix of profitability away from North America. A strong balance sheet also provides plenty of ammunition for M&A.

# Investment summary

**Long-term drivers remain supportive** – Key long-term global drivers remain supportive to Keller's industry, ground engineering, where it is a market leader. Management estimates there is a large addressable global market worth c. £49bn, of which Keller has a c. 6% share, with a c. 13% share of the markets in which operates. The order book was strong at H1 25 and was broadly maintained at the FY 24 record level of £1.6bn. It was particularly encouraging to see the North America order book fall only 1.4% (CC), given the challenging macro environment.

**The macro environment has been challenging** – A variety of macro data points to weakness in the US market; single-family housing starts have trended downward in 2025, US mortgage applications remain low in a historical context, and the probability of a US recession remains elevated. However, encouragingly, the dodge momentum index may have inflected after collapsing in early 2025. We also remain confident in the long-term opportunity within US infrastructure, given the aged nature of assets. Elsewhere, markets are mixed for the EME business – with weakness in residential and commercial, but resilience in infrastructure – but long-term we see a significant opportunity in Ukraine. The APAC business continues to perform well, and building approvals are trending up in Australia.

**Medium-term guidance for divisional margins implies 269.0p of FD EPS, 15.2% upside to our FY 27 estimate** – In North America, management has most recently guided to a sustainable margin of 8% to 9%, while at EME, if price competition eases, management believes that a sustainable EBIT margin of 4-5% can be achieved. If we take our FY 27 estimates but assume a margin of 9.0% for North America, 5.0% for EME and 8.5% for APAC (broadly in line with our FY 27 estimate of 8.4%) making no other changes, we derive FD EPS of 269.0p. This represents upside of 15.2% to our FY 27 estimate of 233.5p.

**We estimate possible 25% EPS accretion from acquisitions in FY 27** – In accordance with its capital allocation policy, we expect management to consider M&A – particularly given the success of recent acquisitions, including Nordpile, Subterranean, Voges and RECON in 2021, and GKM and NWF in November 2022. In addition, with FY 25E net debt (excl. leases) / EBITDA 0.0x, there is clearly scope for higher leverage. We use buyback maths to estimate the possible creation from acquisitions. We assume that the buyback acquisition takes place on 01 January 2026 for consideration of £290.4m. This would increase the leverage on a net debt (excl. leases) basis to 1x EBITDA, in the middle of the target range. Our analysis indicates this would lead to 25% accretion in FD EPS for FY 26 and 25% for FY 27.

**BUY, TP 2040p; a CY 26 P/E of 6.0x is attractive** – Keller is trading below its Construction 'peers' and at an even larger discount to Consultants on a P/E basis. A CY 26 P/E of 6.0x is far too cheap given the strong cash generation and the capital allocation options. The diverse revenues by geography and sector also leaves Keller well insulated from any national cyclicality.

# Buyback and lower tax drive small EPS upgrade

At the interims, we left our EBIT estimates unchanged despite an estimated £7m FX headwind, but increased FY 26 FD EPS by 5.8% due to the new buyback and reduction in the tax rate. We expect a recovery at EME but a challenging market in North America. However, we see potential margin upside in both North America and EME; we estimate FD EPS of 269.0p based on medium-term guidance, representing 15.2% upside to our FY 27 estimate. We see the business model as relatively low risk. At the interims, we changed our FY 25 estimate from net cash (excl. leases) of £20m to net debt of £5m to reflect the £25m buyback. Using buyback maths, we estimate possible 25% EPS accretion in FY 27 from acquisitions.

## We left our EBIT estimates unchanged despite an estimated £7m FX headwind, but increased FY 26 FD EPS by 5.8% due to the new buyback and reduction in the tax rate

Management guides to maintained expectations despite FX headwinds, which we estimate to be £7m, assuming that spot rates prevail. Crucially, the £21.3m EBIT reduction in H1 25 relating to price normalisation at Suncoast should not repeat in H2, as pricing was already more normal in H2 24.

We increased the net interest expense by £0.38m for FY 25, assuming 6% interest on the £25m buyback to be completed in Q4 25, and increase FY 26 by a further £1.9m.

We show our PBT bridge from FY 24 to FY 25, which details the key moving parts. In particular, it shows that we expect revenue growth in North America to be largely offset by margin contraction, while EME should enjoy margin expansion despite broadly flat revenue.

We also reduced our WaNoS for the forecasting horizon, assuming that the £25m additional buyback is spread evenly across Q4.

At the interims management stated its intention to increase the DPS by 5% yoy for FY 25, which is consistent with our estimate of 5%.

We summarise our estimates below.

Our estimates assume a FD EPS H1 weighting of 48%. This is broadly in line with history (average H1 weighting FY 21-24: 41%), but lower than the exceptionally high H1 weighting of 52% in FY 24.

## Our estimates are in line with guidance, which historically has been cautious

We show consensus EPS and the outturn since 2022. This shows that management has set guidance cautiously, with consensus FD EPS estimates either in line or ahead of actuals.

## Recovery at EME but potential softness in North America

We assume a softening in the North America market, largely reflecting macro-economic weakness, and recovery in EME. However, the US is likely to remain the key profit contributor for the foreseeable future.

## Potential margin upside in North America and EME; we estimate FD EPS of 269.0p based on medium-term guidance

The business is performing well operationally across the board. However, we believe that the business has a little more to go for in the US and EME, relative to consensus.

In North America, management has most recently guided to a sustainable margin of 8% to 9%. However, at H1 it achieved 9.5% without any unusual items and despite the drag on margins from Suncoast. We therefore believe that management may reconsider its medium-term margin guidance for the US at the FY results.

In EME, if price competition eases, management believes that a sustainable EBIT margin of 4-5% can be achieved.

At the group level, management previously stated that it targets mid to high single-digit EBIT margins in the medium term, which is broadly consistent with the divisional targets. In addition, we believe 8% is reasonable given the historical group margin, and the rationalised product and geographic portfolio.

**Figure 7: Keller's operating margin over time (%)**

# Historical Margin (%) (2001–2027E)

| Year  | Margin % |
|-------|----------|
| 2001  | 6.5%     |
| 2003  | 6.0%     |
| 2005  | 6.0%     |
| 2007  | 11.5%    |
| 2009  | 9.0%     |
| 2011  | 2.5%     |
| 2013  | 5.5%     |
| 2015  | 6.5%     |
| 2017  | 5.5%     |
| 2019  | 4.5%     |
| 2021  | 5.0%     |
| 2023  | 3.5%     |
| 2025E | 7.0%     |
| 2027E | 7.2%     |

*Source: Liberum estimates, Company reports*

If we take our FY 27 estimates but assume a margin of 9.0% for North America, 5.0% for EME and 8.5% for APAC (broadly in line with our FY 27 estimate of 8.4%) making no other changes, we derive FD EPS of 269.0p. This represents upside of 15.2% to our FY 27 estimate of 233.5p.

## The business model is relatively low risk

As we have written before, management has taken a variety of steps to reduce the risks to which the group is exposed. The business is well balanced in terms of sectors and geographies.

There is also low single-customer reliance, and 57% of total revenue relates to contracts with a value of less than £5m. Therefore, any weakness in project execution in North America had less of an impact than it otherwise might. The low single-customer reliance and contract sizes will keep risks controlled for future periods.

## We changed our FY 25 estimate from net cash (excl. leases) of £20m to net debt of £5m to reflect the £25m buyback

We changed our FY 25 estimate from net cash (excl. leases) of £20m to net debt of £5m to reflect the new £25m buy back. We assume broadly neutral working capital, with a slight outflow of £0.9m.

Including leases, we estimate FY 25 net debt of £96.0, or 0.3x net debt/EBITDA.

In accordance with its capital allocation policy, we expect management to consider M&A, particularly in North America and Europe. If these are not forthcoming, we would expect management to consider more distributions through buybacks.

Management is keen to keep its options open and maintain good discipline for capital deployment. If Keller is already present in a market, and knows the people and customers well, we believe this should result in lower execution risk on acquisitions.

In the US, there are a number of geographies and markets where Keller is under-indexed. There is scope to target these areas through organic growth

**Higher capex to reduce free cash flow to £101.5m in FY 25**

In FY 25, we estimate that organic cash flow in the business will be £101.5m, down from £192.6m in FY 24 due principally to higher capex and the absence of a working capital inflow.

## Using buyback maths, we estimate possible 25% EPS accretion in FY 27 from acquisitions

Keller is an asset-backed business with strong momentum and clearly has scope for higher leverage. We believe that acquisitions are likely. However, as we do not know the terms of any acquisition, we use buyback maths to determine the possible level of accretion from acquisitions. We assume that the buyback acquisition takes place on 01 January 2026 for consideration of £290.4m. This would increase the leverage on a net debt (excl. leases) basis to 1x EBITDA, in the middle of the target range. Our analysis indicates this would lead to 25% accretion in FD EPS for FY 26 and 25% for FY 27.

## Challenging macro but structural drivers are supportive

Long-term drivers remain supportive for Keller and the company has strong market positions. There is plenty more to go for; Keller currently captures £3bn of a £49bn market. The H1 25 order book broadly was flat at the FY 24 record level of £1.6bn. In North America, the order book is down only 1.4% in CC, despite the challenging macro. At EME, markets are mixed and management is taking a disciplined approach to NEOM. The APAC business continues to perform well.

### Long-term drivers remain supportive

Key long-term global drivers continue to provide support for ground engineering.

The North American business has done well to broadly maintain the order book in a difficult construction market. There has been particular strength in datacentres in North America. In EME, several large infrastructure projects are being replaced by smaller contracts.

We note that management has remained disciplined in bidding for work on NEOM. There are significant additional opportunities in Energy, datacentres, EVs, US re-shoring, and semiconductors. Clients are more price focused than in FY 24.

## In North America, the order book is down only 1.4% in CC, despite the challenging macro

The order book is sound – down only 1% in CC to £1,026m - and there is a good level of tendering on large contracts.

Infrastructure in the US is significantly aged. In 2021, the average age of roads, dams, water treatment plants, and lock chambers exceeded their respective life expectancies, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

More recently in March 2025, the ASCE estimated that investment needed for US infrastructure is $9,139bn to 2033, although it also estimated a funding gap of $3,689bn. Nonetheless, required investment in US infrastructure will present opportunities for Keller.

However, some of the macro data recently has been challenging.

Total US housing starts rose 4.5% in June 2025, having fallen 7.2% in May. However, single housing starts fell 4.6% in June 2025, having remained broadly flat in May. Both total and single housing starts have broadly trended downward in 2025.

Steel prices increased in May, but have softened since. Management envisages no repeat of the issues of the past given that steel prices are less volatile and much better managed. Furthermore, commercial is soft anyway, so the impact is likely to be less than in the past.

## At EME, markets are mixed and management is taking a disciplined approach to NEOM

In the Europe and Middle East division, weak demand persisted in the residential and commercial sectors across Europe, whilst the infrastructure sector continued to remain resilient. A previously highlighted challenging project is performing to plan, and should be delivered within the provisions made at the FY. Discussions with the client to remedy commercial performance continue.

In January 2024, Keller announced work worth c. $80m on Trojena, the Winter sport development in NEOM. This work has not completed yet but management targets completion by FY 25 year-end.

Regarding NEOM, management has identified seven or eight different projects, but is taking a disciplined approach. Trojena is very technical and plays to Keller's strengths. On the Line, management sees a number of other opportunities. However, it has re-deployed most of the people and equipment from the first works order, which means it does not need to win more work.

Keller has not seen the benefits of fiscal expansion in Germany yet, but they should come.

In the Nordics, there are some large infrastructure opportunities.

At the FY 24 results we wrote about the significant possible opportunity for reconstruction in Ukraine. There is no mention of Ukraine in the statement. However, on the assumption that all wars must end at some stage, it is logical to assume that there is massive rebuilding work to be done. The World Bank have estimated that the cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine over the next decade will be $524bn.

# FD EPS down 5%, but 13% ahead of our estimate

H1 25 FD EPS fell by 5% to 98.1p, due to strong comparatives, but was 13% ahead of our estimate. In North America, the margin fell as expected to a still creditable 9.5%. At EME, there was strong operational performance. At APAC, there was strength at Australia and Austral. Net debt (exc. leases) increased from £29.5m in FY 24 to £61.5m, 0.2x net debt / EBITDA, due to a normalisation of working capital. A high level of provisioning suggests a cautious approach. Non-financial KPIs continues to trend positively.

In Central Europe there was an adverse impact of £4.8m due to the non-repeat of a large project in Germany.

At Moretrench and Recon there was a £4.8m benefit yoy relating to strong volume-driven performance, aided by benign weather.

At Keller Australia there was a £3.2m benefit from some settlement gains.

In the Middle East there was a £11.1m benefit from the non-repeat of a loss on NEOM.

Underlying FD EPS fell by 5% from 103.3p in H1 24 to 98.1p (vs Panmure Liberum: 87.1p). There were £5.3m of non-underlying pre-tax costs principally in respect of £4.1m of ERP implementation costs. The company has declared an H1 25 DPS of 18.3p, up 10% on H1 24.

There were £4.7m of non-underlying items in operating costs, and £0.8m worth of amortisation of acquired intangible assets. This was partially offset by non-underlying income of £0.2m, relating to the receipt of contingent consideration. We summarise the key costs below.

## At APAC, there was strength at Australia and Austral

At APAC, CC revenues increased 2.9% to £181.6m, and underlying CC EBIT increased 36.3% to £13.9m. This has been driven by higher profitable growth at Keller Australia and Austral, including the benefit of several project closure settlements at Keller Australia.

## Net debt (exc. leases) increased from £29.5m in FY 24 to £61.5m, 0.2x net debt / EBITDA, due to a normalisation of working capital

H1 25 spot net debt was £61.5m (vs Panmure Liberum: £50m), or 0.2x net debt/EBITDA, on an IAS 17 basis versus £100.7m at H1 24.

Average month-end net debt (excl. leases) was £39.2m, down from £112.4m in H1 24.

Cash performance has normalised, particularly working capital, after high cash conversion in FY 23 and FY 24. However, leverage is below the target range of 0.5x to 1.5x.

There was a £78m working capital outflow due to investment in Europe and the Middle East. This primarily comprised a) increased inventory including Suncoast steel; and b) the unwind of some large advanced payments in Europe and the Middle East. There was a £27.7m increase in inventories and £73.1m increase in receivables. At the results presentation management guided to better working capital in H2 due to seasonality.

Free cash flow decreased from £88.6m to £14.3m. There was a £25m buyback. IAS 17 net debt excludes £93.1m of lease liabilities, down from £98.7m in the PY.

At H1 2025 there were undrawn borrowing facilities of £445.5m (£400m committed and £45.5m uncommitted), as well as cash and cash equivalents of £156.6m.

## BUY recommendation and TP of 2040p

Keller is trading below its Construction 'peers' and at an even larger discount to Consultants on a P/E basis. A CY 26 P/E of 6.0x is far too cheap given the strong cash generation and the capital allocation options. The diverse revenues by geography and sector also leaves Keller well insulated from any national cyclicality.
