# A POISON TREE KNOWLEDGE ORGANISER

## Context

**A Poison Tree** was written by William Blake and was published in Songs of Experience in 1794.

**William Blake** – William Blake (1757-1827) was an English poet and painter. He is known as being one of the leading figures of the Romantic Movement. Blake rejected established religious and political orders for their failures– some of the many things that he viewed as being a part of the 'fallen human nature.' He had a complex relationship with religion, believing the imagination to be the most important element of human existence. This ran contrary to Enlightenment ideas.

**Songs of Innocence and Experience** – Published in 1794, these two sets of poems were created by Blake with the aim of showing the 'Two Contrary States of the Human Soul.' The Songs of Innocence collection contains poems that are uplifting, celebrating childhood, nature, and love in a positive tone. The Songs of Experience section (of which A Poison Tree was one of the poems) offered a contrasting tone towards these ideas. Some of the topics covered in these poems were indignation, revenge, and the fallen state of mankind.

**The Garden of Eden** – Also known as 'Paradise' the biblical garden of God is referred to in the books of Genesis and Ezekiel. The bible states that Adam and Eve (the first humans) were placed into the garden (naked, showing their innocence) before being tempted by a serpent to eat forbidden fruit from the Tree of Life. They were thus expelled from the garden. In A Poison Tree, the tree, apple, and garden represent the speaker's anger, alluding to the biblical story.

**Romanticism** – Romanticism was an artistic, literary, musical, cultural and intellectual movement that originated in Europe in the latter half of the 18th Century, peaking in the mid-19th Century. Romanticism is characterised by its emphasis on emotions - glorifying nature and past events – memories and settings are often imaginatively described using vivid imagery. Although Blake struggled to make a living during his lifetime, his ideas and influence were later considered amongst the most important of all the Romantic Poets.

<td>The reader immediately notes the simplicity of the language – it mirrors the nursery rhymes and children's verses popular at the time, and (like the poem) were intended to teach moral lessons. The lesson provided in the opening quatrain is therefore seemingly simple to decode: do not suppress feelings of anger, or they will grow; the best way to rid oneself of anger is to express it. The complexity arises from the use of the terms 'friend' and 'foe.' The poem seeks to explore how people classify one another with these labels and alter their course of behaviour as a result. The trochee lines (e.g. line 1) force the line on, reflecting how pushy the speaker is. In contrast the iambic lines slow the poem down.</td>

<td>The second quatrain describes how the speaker tends to and cultivates his anger, which has made it grow. The metaphor begins that runs throughout the poem, as the wrath is compared to a small plant. He explains how he 'waterd' his anger with 'tears' and 'sunned' it with 'soft deceitful wiles.' 'Wiles' implies that the speaker is in some way laying a trap for his foe – he pretends to be friendly to his foe, his false smiles acting like sunshine in enabling his anger to develop. The speaker thus represents the duplicity of his behaviour, and the innocence is gone. Line 7, in which this occurs, contains two trochees and iamb, to wrong-foot the reader.</td>

<td>In the third quatrain, the small plant has developed into an actual tree – revealing the extent to which his anger has been cultivated. Furthermore, the metaphor is extended through the introduction of the apple. The apple represents the 'fruits' of his resentment. It has been chosen because it is commonly seen as the fruit of hatred and revenge in many cultures. It also refers to the apple in the biblical story of The Garden of Eden, in which the apple is used by the serpent to tempt Eve. The tree and apple promise a world of good (hence the shine), but actually brings woe to the world (it was mine). In this light, the speaker could be seen as the serpent. The poem now adopts a larger meaning, as the biblical connection introduces the idea of God's indignation at humankind's perceived failures. The repetition of 'And' shows the persistent, ceaseless development of the anger throughout the poem.</td>

The 'veild pole' gives the impression that the visibility of the pole star, an aid to navigation, has been in some way impaired. The speaker's sense of moral direction has thus been veiled. The final couplet reveals the result of the speaker's treachery – 'outstretched' may mean dead, meaning that the foe has succumbed to the poison. The idea that the speaker is 'glad' about this reinforces the poem's meaning – that despite the damage caused, the problems of human anger remain.</td>

## Language/Structural Devices

**Metaphors** – An extended metaphor runs throughout the poem, which compares anger to the eponymous tree of the title. The negative emotions begin as a seed, and are cultivated into a plant, then a tree (as read in the line 'I waterd it in fears') is compared to cultivating a plant. The emotion is followed through an entire growth cycle until it results in death. The second metaphor ties the poem into the biblical story of Adam and Eve. In doing so, the suppression of anger is presented as an original sin.

Quote: "And it grew both day and night.
Till it bore an apple bright.

**Alliteration** – Alliteration is used throughout the poem to echo the sounds of the anger developing. For example, there is a repeated 's' sound throughout quatrain 2, which resembles the sound of the speaker hissing with anger, whilst presenting smiles to the face of his foe. Furthermore, in quatrain 3, the repetition of the harsh 'b' sound shows the hidden danger of the apple, cultivated to tempt the foe.

Quote: "And I sunned it with smiles,
And with soft deceitful wiles."

**Form** – The poem is written in four equal stanzas of four lines. Rhyme is used throughout in the scheme of AABB. The rhyme creates deliberate emphasis on words that underline the tone of the poem, e.g. 'fears', 'tears', 'smiles' and 'wiles.' The poem is told from the viewpoint of a first person narrator – we are only exposed to their point of view.

Quote: "And into my garden stole,
When the night had veild the pole;"

**Imagery** – Blake uses a range of vocabulary choices to create vivid images in the mind of the reader. Rather than presenting anger as an abstract emotion for example, it is brought to life in the form of the poison tree. The physical ideas of watering and sunning the plant offer a visual image of the anger growing. Other vivid images presented to the reader include the 'shine' of the apple, the pole star being 'veild' and the foe laying 'outstretched' at the foot of the tree. Abstract ideas are visually depicted through Blake's imagery.

Quote: "And I waterd it in fears,
Night & morning with my tears:"

**Simple Language** – Blake uses straightforward language throughout the poem, which is easy to follow. Such simplicity may be seen to represent how anger is often perceived as a simple, instinctive emotion. On the contrary, Blake demonstrates how it is complex and destructive. The simple language also gives the poem a nursery rhyme feel, which the reader associates with learning a moral lesson.

Quote: "I was angry with my friend;
I told my wrath, my wrath did end."

**Structure** – Each stanza details a different stage of the development of the anger. In the first stanza, the wrath is initially hidden. In the second stanza, the anger begins to grow, rather like a small plant that feeds on resentment. In stanza 3, the anger is used to deceive the foe, and in stanza 4, the violent product of the anger is revealed.

Quote: "In the morning glad I see;
My foe outstretched beneath the tree."

## Themes

Themes – A theme is an idea or message that runs throughout a text.

**Suppression of Anger** – The main theme of A Poison Tree is not anger itself, but rather the destructive effects of the cultivation of anger. The poem emphasises that when a person hides or denies their emotions, the feelings are enabled to grow. Blake expresses this through the metaphor of the poison tree, which is fed by continued resentment.

**Lies and Deceit** – The speaker hides his anger through 'soft deceitful wiles', and his cultivation of this anger eventually produces an apple, which is deceptively bright and shiny. This is designed to lure the foe to his demise. The foe is also revealed to be partaking in deceitful acts, as he 'steals' into the speaker's garden.

## Poems for Comparison

**Exposure** – A Poison Tree can be compared and contrasted with this poem in relation to the themes of futility and suffering

**No Problem** – A Poison Tree can be compared and contrasted with this poem in the approach to the theme of anger and forgiveness.

## Wider Reading

Although it can be read by itself, 'A Poison Tree' benefits significantly from being read as a further expression of the poems immediately preceding it in Songs of Experience, especially 'The Garden of Love' and 'The Human Abstract.' In the three poems, Blake criticizes the imposition of religious and social morality on the human sensibility, suggesting that it stifles the goodness and love inherent in a spirit not fettered by such rules. In Blake's Notebook, the original title of 'A Poison Tree' is 'Christian Forbearance,' which the poem criticizes as the cause of hypocrisy.– www.encyclopedia.com

# BELFAST CONFETTI KNOWLEDGE ORGANISER

## Context
**Belfast Confetti** was written by Ciaran Carson and was published in 1989.

**Ciaran Carson** – Cieran Carson (born 1948) is a Belfast-born Northern-Irish poet and novelist. He was born into an Irish speaking family, and only picked up the English language from playing with local friends. His work is personal and political in its coverage of events from the past – particularly The Troubles and violence in Northern Ireland. In 1969, Carson narrowly avoided death in The Troubles, when a bullet tore through a taxi that he was sitting in. His poetry has won many awards.

**Ireland** – Ireland is an island in the North Atlantic, separated from Great Britain by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St. George's Channel. The island is made up of the Republic of Ireland (often shortened to 'Ireland'), which makes up about five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is a part of the UK (see 'The Troubles'). The Irish climate is heavily influenced by the Atlantic Ocean, which borders it to the east. Ireland is the second-most populous island in Europe, with about 6.6 million inhabitants.

**The Troubles** – The Troubles is the name given to the conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th Century. Over 3,600 people were killed and thousands more were injured. Two separate factions fought over the constitutional status of the country, with the goal of the unionist side to remain part of the UK, and the nationalist side to become part of Ireland. As a result, the violence also spilled into Great Britain and Ireland. It was settled in the Good Friday agreement of 1998.

**The Good Friday Agreement** – The Good Friday Agreement of 1998 is largely viewed as the settlement of The Troubles, which enabled relative peace in Northern Ireland. The present devolved system of government in Northern Ireland stems from the agreement. It included a multi-party agreement between Northern Ireland's political parties and the agreement between the British and Irish governments. Both had to be approved by the public through referendums (which they were) before they became valid.

<td>'Suddenly' throws the reader directly into the action, just as the speaker was. The extended metaphor utilising punctuation to emphasise the breaks in society begins with 'exclamation marks raining down.' The violent conflict is breaking down language between the factions. The listing in line 3 conveys a sense of panic – full sentences can no longer be articulated in the chaos. The fact that these are everyday objects demonstrates how the ordinary has become deadly. The sound of gunshots are echoed in the use of terms such as 'rapid fire' and 'stuttering' and are visually depicted through the use of the ellipsis.

'Dead end' is deliberately ambiguous – further reinforcing the undercurrent of division and violence. Upon being questioned by the soldiers, the speaker now fails to answer the simplest of questions (line 17) showing how disorientated they have become. The poem does not end definitively, but rather with unanswered questions.</td>

## Language/Structural Devices

**Metaphors** – An extended metaphor runs throughout the poem, which compares Belfast to a sentence that has been broken and blocked up by punctuation marks. The punctuation marks themselves are used to represent different features of the troubles. For example, exclamation marks and hyphenated marks represent weapons and debris, whilst full stops and colons depict the city 'blocked with stops and colons.' The whole poem can be seen as a metaphor for the way that violent conflict destroys language.

**Quote:** "Suddenly as the riot squad moved in it was raining exclamation marks,"

**Questions** – The sense of chaos and confusion is emphasised through the use of interspersed questions throughout. The speaker is seen to be constantly questioning what is going on, for example 'why can't I escape?' 'Where am I coming from?' Many of these questions are appear to be echoes of questions being asked of the speaker by others – e.g. 'My name?' and 'Where am I going?' – which adds to the sense of mistrust.

**Quote:** "My name? Where am I coming from? Where am I going? A fusillade of question-marks."

**Form** – The poem is written in two stanzas, perhaps to represent how Belfast/ Northern Ireland has become divided between the two factions. The varying line lengths, alongside the lack of rhyme or consistent rhythm, reflect the chaos of the riots. The different line lengths also mirror how different streets have been cut off by the factions and riot squads.

**Quote:** "All the alleyways and side-streets blocked with stops and/ colons."

**Enjambment and Caesura** – Enjambment and caesura serve to speed up slow down, link and break up different sections of the poem. The heavy use of enjambment and caesura throughout creates a sense of unease – the unsteady flow of the poem makes the reader more insecure and apprehensive, mirroring the feelings of those caught in the conflict. Caesura and enjambment also combine to create a sense of being cut off as communication systems fail. A prime example of this is in lines 13 and 14.

**Quote:** "Why can't I escape? Every move is punctuated. Crimea Street/ Dead end again."

**Everyday Objects** – Carson reveals how, in this environment, everyday objects are turned into dangerous weapons. For example, in the first stanza, Carson details how 'nuts', 'bolts', and 'car keys' are used in bombs. The title itself mirrors this idea; 'Confetti' is ordinarily used for celebration, but here it is used to describe the shrapnel originating from bombs, which rains down on the city.

**Quote:** "Nuts, bolts, nails, car-keys. A fount of broken type. And/ the explosion"

**Structure** – The poem opens as the chaos commences, as signalled by the opening adverbial 'Suddenly.' What follows is a rapid deterioration of any sort of order. In stanza 1, the speaker is just about able to offer details regarding the riot, but by the end of stanza 2, their sense of clarity has reduced to such an extent that they question themselves.

**Quote:** "I was trying to complete a sentence in my head, but it kept/ stuttering,"

## Themes

**A theme is an idea or message that runs throughout a text.**

**Disorder** – A number of devices combine to make the city appear fragmented and confusing. Everyday objects are utilised as weapons, those who should be neighbours are fighting one another, and at every turn there are blockages and chaos. Carson takes the reader to a place in which all rules regarding order and structure have perished.

**Divided Society** – Carson presents a place in which factions have developed in society – representative of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The divisions are shown through the structure of the poem (e.g. the two stanzas, the differing line lengths) and also its content (e.g. the barricades and blockages at every turn, cutting streets off).

## Poems for Comparison

**What Were They Like?** - Belfast Confetti can be compared and contrasted with this poem in relation to the themes of disorder

**The Class Game/ No Problem** - Belfast Confetti can be compared and contrasted with these poems in the approach to the theme divided society.

## Wider Reading

"I write in English, but the ghost of Irish hovers behind it; and English itself is full of ghostly presences," he suggests two influences on his poetry: his bilingual upbringing, and an unusual alertness to language. He shows language being used to enforce, to spy, and - broken into its almost meaningless constituent parts - to commit physical violence, when the bomb in 'Belfast Confetti' is loaded with not only ironmongery but "a fount of broken type.".– www.essalanglit.com

# CATRIN KNOWLEDGE ORGANISER

## Context
**Catrin** was written by Gillian Clarke and was first published in 1978.

**Gillian Clarke** – Gillian Clarke (born 1937) is a Welsh poet, who was awarded the Queen's Gold Medal for poetry in 2010. She graduated in English at Cardiff University, before spending a year working for the BBC in London. She then returned to Cardiff, giving birth to her daughter (Catrin: hence this poem) and two sons. She learnt to speak Welsh as an adult and often translates Welsh literature into English. She was the National Poet of Wales between 2008 and 2016. She continues to live and work in Wales.

**Clarke's Welsh Background** – Clarke was born into an English speaking family in Wales, and only learnt to speak Welsh as an adult 'partially as a form of rebellion.' She is proud of her Welsh heritage and makes efforts to ensure that the Welsh language is shared worldwide – translating Welsh texts into English. She often weaves characteristics of Welsh-language poetry into her work, e.g. strict metres. She also contrasts rural life in Wales with notable international events.

**Realism** – Realism in literature is a part of the realist art movement (seen in all forms of art and literature) that began in the mid-twentieth century. Realism attempts to represent familiar things as they are. Authors of realist texts choose to describe everyday or banal activities, as opposed to romanticising or colourfully elaborating ideas. Realistic poems often describe subjects from contemporary, conventional life, often focusing more on the individual characters and their feelings than on dramatic or sensational events.

**Parental Bond** – A parental bond is the bond between a parent and child, often referred to as either the maternal bond (mother/child) or the paternal bond (father/child) Research suggests that both bonds have a biological basis, with changes taking place in the brains and hormones of mothers and fathers before and after the birth of their child. Further studies have shown that children who grow up to happy and stable often develop strong bonds as infants with their parents.

## Language/Structural Devices

**Metaphors** – An extended metaphor runs throughout the poem, which compares the bond between mother and daughter to red rope. This red rope may literally symbolise the umbilical cord throughout the earliest stages of their relationship, but comes to represent the link that ties mother and daughter together. Another metaphor exists in the idea of the square/tank which their relationship inhabits. It is 'blank' and 'disinfected' at the start, but becomes 'clouded with feelings' as their emotions towards each other build.

> Quote: "Red rope of love which we both Fought over"

**Alliteration** – Alliteration is used frequently throughout the poem, for a range of effects. At the beginning of the first stanza, for example, the repetition of 'w' and 't' sounds in lines 3 and 5 creates a sense of repetition and monotony at the dull scene outside. On the other hand, the repetition of 'f' at the beginning of stanza 2 echoes the expletives that the two use towards each other as they partake in full-blown arguments, throughout Catrin's adolescence.

> Quote: "In the glass tank clouded with feelings Which changed us both. Still I am fighting"

**Form** – The poem is written in two stanzas, which deal with separate stages of life, but with the same themes – perhaps representing their will to be independent despite the bond that keeps them together. There is little rhyme in the poem, and a frequently interrupted rhythm, which goes to show the conflicted and unsteady nature of their relationship.

> Quote: "Neither won nor lost the struggle In the glass tank clouded with feelings"

**Enjambment and Caesura** – Enjambment and caesura serve to speed up slow down, link and break up different sections of the poem. The heavy use of enjambment and caesura throughout creates a sense of unease – the unsteady flow of the poem makes the reader more insecure and apprehensive, mirroring the nature of the mother/daughter relationship. Caesura and enjambment also combine to create a sense of being cut off – as the two long for isolation from one another – a sense of individual identity.

> Quote: "Which changed us both. Still I am fighting You off, as you stand there"

**Oxymoron** – Contradictory ideas are juxtaposed beside one another in order to show the differing personalities of the mother and daughter, who are still tied together by the maternal bond. 'Hot' and 'white' in stanza 1 shows the conflicted nature of their relationship, which is new, neutral and sterile, and yet already tainted by love and passion. 'Wild, tender circles' is another example, showing the inclination of the individuals towards adventure and safety.

> Quote: "With the wild, tender circles Of our struggle to become"

**Structure** – The first stanza is written about the time of Catrin's birth, and deals with the early relationship between the two. In the climax, it is recalled how this is difficult, as they fought to be separate beings. The second stanza shows Catrin as an adolescent, fighting to be adventurous and struggling for independence. The climax reveals more struggles to come.

> Quote: "As you ask may you skate In the dark, for one more hour."

## Themes

**Maternal Love** – The poem explores the persisting strength and durability of the maternal love, in the face of ceaseless conflict. This conflict seems to be unavoidable, and has a notable effect on both the parent and the offspring. In any case, they remain attached by the 'red rope' of their bond, creating a deeper love than any other.

**Togetherness and Individuality** - From the gruelling first obstacle together of childbirth, both Catrin and her mother are locked together by an eternal bond. Whilst this brings them deep togetherness, they also struggle to establish themselves as individuals. Catrin longs to seek adventure, whilst the speaker tires of the responsibility.

## Poems for Comparison

**Poppies** - Catrin can be compared and contrasted with this poem in relation to the theme of maternal love.

**No Problem** - Catrin can be compared and contrasted with these poems in the approach to the theme togetherness and individuality

## Wider Reading

"People are sweet, they come to a poetry reading and say, 'I really enjoyed that and I haven't read a poem since I was a child, but when I was a child I loved poetry', and I think, of course you did, we must stay as children. We loved nursery rhymes, and we still love those things. I just hope that person who comes up to me and says that will come again. "There are such wonderful poets from the 19th century. I studied them at university and they are the great romantic poets – Wordsworths, Shelleys, Keats, they're fantastic, but that's then, we must write for now" www.essalanglit.com

# COUSIN KATE KNOWLEDGE ORGANISER

## Context
**Cousin Kate** was written by Christina Rossetti in 1859, and was first published in 1862.

**Christina Rossetti** – Christina Rossetti (1830-1894) was an English poet who mainly wrote romantic and children's poems. She was born into a gifted family – the youngest child of the renowned Italian-exile poet Gabriele Rossetti and Frances Polidori, the sister of Lord Byron's best friend: John Polidori. In her lifetime, opinion was divided over whether she or Elizabeth Barrett Browning was the best female poet of all time. Rossetti's poetry is famed for having an exceptional lyrical quality, diction and tone, using simple forms.

**The Victorian Era** – The Victorian era describes the period in which Queen Victoria sat on the English throne – between 1837 and 1901 (most of Rossetti's life). Whilst this was a time of industrial revolution, it was also an extremely harsh time to live, and the differences between the lives of the richest and the poorest were exacerbated. The Victorian era was a period of great change. In this time, the population of England doubled – from 16.8 million 1851 to over 30 million in 1901.

**The Class System** – Although the class system was less fixed than in earlier history, class divisions still separated different people in society from one another. Society was made up of aristocrats and noble families, middle classes, and working classes, and social mobility was difficult. For example, it was integral for both the man and the woman to marry someone of a suitable class and reputation. It would bring shame on a family for someone to marry too much out of lust and below the family class/reputation.

**Love and Courtship Rules** – Although some laws had changed since the Georgian/ Regency eras, much of the power in love and courtship remained with men. Men were largely free to act as they liked outside of marriage, whilst women were expected to exhibit chaste behaviour. Women with children who were unmarried were regarded as 'fallen.' It is interesting to note in that Rossetti volunteered for a charity for fallen women from 1859, which likely influenced the subject matter of the poem.

## Language/Structural Devices

**Similes and Metaphors** – A number of similes and metaphors run throughout the poem, figuratively representing the complex behaviours and emotions at play. For example, in stanza 2, the speaker compares herself to different clothing garments when in the presence of the lord (like a silken knot, like a glove), showing that he viewed her merely as a garment – an accessory that could be changed at his pleasure. The speaker also uses the ring to jealously symbolise the lord's entrapment of Kate, in stanza 4.

**Quote:** "Because you were so good and pure
He bound you with his ring:"

**Alliteration** – Alliteration is used frequently throughout the poem, for a range of effects. In stanza 1 for example, the repetition of the soft 'm' sound (maiden, mates, mindful) is used to reflect the beauty and innocence of the girls at work. In detailing the affair in stanza 2, the sibilance in 'shameless, shameful' echoes the hushed manner of the affair. Furthermore, the speaker's anger comes through the harsh consonants in 'O Lady Kate, my cousin Kate.'

**Quote:** "To lead a shameless shameful life,
His plaything and his love."

**Form** – The poem is written as a dramatic monologue, from the viewpoint of the rejected former lover of the lord. She directs the poem directly to Cousin Kate. There are six stanzas, each of which rhyme A-B-C-B-D-E-D-F. It is written in 3 and 4 foot iambic trimeters and tetrameters, which gives the poem a pronounced rhythm.

**Quote:** "If you stood where I stand...
Nor bought me with his land;"

**Repetition and Contrast** – Repeated phrases are used to highlight the differences between the speaker and Cousin Kate. For example, 'good and pure' is repeated to describe Kate in stanza 4, juxtaposed with the idea of the speaker being an 'outcast.' Whilst Kate is able to 'sit in gold', the speaker is forced to 'sit in dust.' However, whilst the speaker professes that her 'love was true', she believes that Kate's was 'writ' in sand. The differences between the two are more emphasised through the use of the repetition.

**Quote:** "O cousin Kate, my love was true,
Your love was writ in sand:"

**Oxymoron** – Contradictory ideas are juxtaposed beside one another in order to mirror the conflicting nature of the speaker's ideas: she wants to create the sense that she is happy, and better off without the lord, when in fact we infer that she is deeply jealous. For example, she refers to her son as 'my shame, my pride,' demonstrating that whilst she appears to be proud of him on the surface, she in fact knows the ignominy that his existence brings upon her.

**Quote:** "My fair-haired son, my shame, my pride,
Cling closer, closer yet:"

**Structure** – The narrative is revealed almost chronologically. In the opening stanza, the speaker recalls the lord picking her out, whilst the second details their relationship. The third stanza is the point at which the lord first sees Kate, and in the fourth he weds her. In the fifth and sixth stanzas, the speaker reveals her feelings, and hers and Kate's differing lives now.

**Quote:** "Yet I've a gift you have not got,
And seem not like to get:"

## Themes
*A theme is an idea or message that runs throughout a text.*

**Class** – The Victorian class system, and its effects on love and marriage, is evident through the behaviour and attitudes of the characters in the poem. The lord, being from an esteemed class, is able to pick and choose whichever of the working women he wants (this is partially a result of gender attitudes as well).

**Alienation** – The pain felt by the speaker at being shunned in favour of Cousin Kate is compounded by the fact that she is outcast by society for indulging in a pre-marital relationship. Despite being no more guilty than the lord, his position as a man allows him to carry on his life as he likes, whilst she is forever tainted as a 'fallen' woman.

## Poems for Comparison

**The Class Game** – Cousin Kate can be compared and contrasted with this poem in relation to the theme of class.

**No Problem** – Cousin Kate can be compared and contrasted with this poem in the approach to the theme of alienation.

## Wider Reading

"In early 1859 Rossetti began volunteering at the St. Mary Magdalene Penitentiary in Highgate, a charitable institution for the reclamation of "fallen" women. As an "associate" at Highgate, Rossetti was known as "Sister Christina" and wore a habitlike black uniform with a veil. By the summer of 1859 Rossetti was devoting a good deal of time to her work at Highgate, and its influence can be seen in her poems about illicit love, betrayal, and illegitimacy, such as "Cousin Kate," www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/christina-rossetti

# EXPOSURE KNOWLEDGE ORGANISER

## Context
**Exposure** was written by Wilfred Owen in 1917.

**Wilfred Owen** – Wilfred Edward Salter Owen (1893-1918) was a British poet and soldier. He was one of the predominant World War I poets, detailing the horrors of trench warfare in a similar style to his mentor: Sigfried Sassoon. His poetry brought a sense of realism to public perceptions of war, in stark contrast to the earlier works of poets such as Rupert Brooke at the time. Owen was killed one week before the end of the war.

**World War I** – World War I, also known as the 'Great War', was a global war originating in Europe that took place from July 1914 to November 1918. It involved all of the world's major powers, opposing the Allies (including Russia, France, UK, and USA) against the Alliance (Germany, Austro-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire) Over 9 millions armed forces and 7 million civilians were killed in the war.

**Trench Warfare** – The use of trench warfare significantly influenced the high death toll. Attacks involved going across No Man's Land (in the middle) where attackers were open to machine gun fire, mines, and shells. Even if successful, casualties were huge. Life in the trenches were awful, with diseases like trench foot rife. Men would often spend weeks at a time on the front line, where they would need to sleep, eat, and defecate in close proximity in the trenches.

**Exposure to the Weather** – The majority of the fighting took place in Europe, where the soldiers faced extremities in temperature and weather over the years. Rain would quickly accumulate in the trenches (sometimes to waist height) whilst in the winter months soldiers would often be battered by snow, hail, and sub-zero temperatures. The winter of 1916-17 was so cold that many lost fingers and toes to frostbite. Trenches offered little to no protection. Even clothes and blankets froze solid.

## Language/Structural Devices

**Personification/Pathetic Fallacy** – Owen persistently personifies the weather to create the impression that the weather is as much of danger to the soldiers as the enemy itself. The weather is constantly referred to as an enemy, for example through suggesting it 'knives' the men, gathers a 'melancholy army' against them, and uses 'stealth' to attack them. The use of pathetic fallacy (e.g. the 'mad gusts') even add emotions and malice to the forces of nature.

**Quote:** "Our brains ache, in the merciless iced east winds that knive us"

**Similes/Metaphors** – Similes and metaphors are used to figuratively describe the physical and psychological pain that the men are enduring. For example, the dawn of a new day is compared to a 'melancholy army' being amassed – a new day signals a repeat of the cycle of misery and despair.

**Quote:** "Dawn massing in the east her melancholy army."

**Form/Structure** – The poem is conventional in the sense that each stanza is five lines long, with eight stanzas in total. Half-rhyme is used throughout to create a A-B-B-A-C rhyme scheme. The fifth line adds a little more to what would normally be expected – this could be seen as representative of the war dragging on for longer than anyone thought.

**Quote:** "Shrivelling many hands, and puckering foreheads crisp/The burying-party, picks and shovels in shaking grasp."

**Sibilance/Alliteration/Assonance** – These language techniques are used to echo/mimic the sounds (or in some cases silence) that the men are exposed to. For example, repetitive use of the 'w' and 's' sounds are representative of the whistling of the wind around them, and even the muffled whispering of the men. Furthermore, awkward 'o' sounds emphasise words, and represents the difficulty the men have in taking their minds off the cold misery that they face.

**Quote:** "Slowly our ghosts drag home: glimpsing the sunk fires, glozed"

**Varied Verbs** – Owen uses some interesting and original verbs to present the discomfort of movement and actions by the exposed soldiers. For example, the frost makes their hands 'shrivel' and their foreheads 'pucker', whilst they are 'shaking.' These are young men in their prime and yet the description of their actions makes them resemble the old and infirm.

**Quote:** "We cringe in holes, back on forgotten dreams, and stare, snow-dazed"

**Versification** – Each of the eight stanzas ends with a short half line. At the end of the first, third, fourth, and eighth lines the refrain 'but nothing happens' is added. This hammers home the message that despite all of the pain and suffering being described, little changes. The last lines, when read alone one after the other, tell their own melancholy story.

**Quote:** "What are we doing here? Is it that we are dying?"

## Themes
A theme is an idea or message that runs throughout a text.

**Suffering** – In order to get across his message across, it was essential that Owen presented the barbaric, appalling nature of war in a realistic manner and tone. In this poem, Owen portrays the quieter moments of war, the painful periods in between the battle and bloodshed. Here, physical pain and psychological trauma can both be taken in more fully, and are described vividly and frankly.

**The Futility of War** – In contrast to many poems at the time that glorified war and fighting for one's country, Owen's poems typically depict war in a harsh light, in order to demonstrate how horrific and futile it is. 'Exposure', in this sense, is no different. His bleak and shockingly realistic portrayal of the soldier's experiences (in this case caused by both the opposition and the forces of nature) forms a stark contrast to general public opinions at the time.

## Poems for Comparison

**Remains** - Exposure can be contrasted with this poem in relation to the theme of Suffering and the Horrors of War.

**Charge of the Light Brigade** - Exposure can be compared with this poem in relation to the theme of suffering and can be contrasted with this poem in their approach to the futility of war.

## Thoughts of the Poet

Dear Mother, Immediately after I sent my last letter, more than a fortnight ago, we were rushed up into the Line. Our A Company led the Attack, and of course lost a certain number of men. I had some extraordinary escapes from shells & bullets…I think the worst incident was one wet night when we lay up against a railway embankment. A big shell lit on the top of the bank, just 2 yards from my head. Before I awoke, I was blown in the air right away from the bank! My brother officer of B Coy., 2/Lt. Gaukroger lay opposite in a similar hole. But he was covered with earth, and no relief will ever relieve him, nor will his Rest be a 9 days' Rest. I think that the terribly long time we stayed unrelieved was unavoidable; yet it makes us feel bitterly towards those in England who might relieve us, and will not. WEO

# HALF-CASTE KNOWLEDGE ORGANISER

## Context
**Half Caste** was written by John Agard, and was published in 2005.

**John Agard** – John Agard (born 1949) is an Afro-Guyanese poet and playwright who now lives in the UK. When he moved to the UK in the 1970s, he began teaching people about Caribbean culture and worked in a library. He often conveys his Caribbean voice in his poems, using non-standard spelling to represent his accent. His poems are often rebellious in nature, challenging common ways of thinking and confronting discriminatory behaviour.

**Guyana** – Guyana is a country on the northern mainland of South America. However, it is often considered as a Caribbean region because of its strong cultural and historical links to Anglo Caribbean nations. It was governed by Britain from the late 18th Century and known as British Guiana until the 1950s. It gained independence in 1966. Many Guyanese families have since emigrated to the UK – in 2009 there were 24,000 Guyanese-born people living in the UK.

**Racism in the UK** – The United Kingdom is a multi-cultural society, largely owing to its imperialist past, and more recent waves of immigration. Racism is also fueled by attitudes linked to the entrenched historical class system. The UK has never implemented any laws that officially discriminate against or segregate people of minorities – however, it is only as recently as the 1960s that the first laws were introduced to actively oppose racist attitudes and behaviour.

**The Term 'Half-Caste'** – Half-caste is a term used to describe people of mixed race or ethnicity. In a number of countries across the world, including Australia and New Zealand, it is seen as a deeply offensive term, whilst in countries like the UK, it is seen increasingly as an offensive term, due to the fact that it implies that someone is 'half-pure' (with the white half being the 'pure' half). The National Union of Journalists have stated that the term is considered offensive today.

<td><strong>Lines 33-41:</strong> The stanza break adds extra emphasis to the refrain, which once again use the imperative verb 'explain' to show the challenging, assertive nature of the speaker. The next part of the poem labels several body parts as 'half' on the half-caste man. When people ask him why he only gives them part of his attention, it is actually because of their use of the derogatory term towards him. He doesn't want to give them his 'full' recognition. 'Yu' and 'u' again involve the reader directly.<br><br><strong>Lines 42-45:</strong> The idea of the speaker sleeping with 'half-a-eye' open is a commonly use metaphor for being nervous and wary – feeling insecure. The speaker here has given the reader a small glimpse of the inner hurt and divisions that the term creates. The adverb 'consequently' reminds the reader that words and actions have consequences: the speaker is unable to fully 'dream' because of the prejudiced nature of the society around him.<br><br><strong>Lines 46-48:</strong> 'Cast' a shadow is another pun (play on words) – again experimenting with the multiple meanings of 'caste.' These lines again return to the idea that he is seen as half a man – an idea at odds with this wonderfully lyrical section of the poem. 'h' and 'm' sounds soften his tone.<br><br><strong>Lines 49-55:</strong> The last 7 lines of the poem are hard-hitting – a complete message in themselves. The idea of being 'whole' is subverted onto the reader: only when they commit to using all of their senses to perceive him will he tell them his full story.</td>

## Language/Structural Devices

**Alliteration, Sibilance and 'Beat'** – Alliteration is used in several places across the poem, particularly of heavy 'p', 'b' and 'd' sounds. This helps to add a beat throughout the poem, creating a more pronounced rhythm and flow – this helps the poem to mirror music popular in the Caribbean. These heavier sounds, blended with sibilance (for example in line 21: 'So spiteful dem don't want de sun pass") presents a personality of toughness and defiance and echoes the speaker's seething inner frustration.

**Quote:** "Sit down at dah piano  
And mix a black key"

**Colloquial Language, Accent and Slang** – Agard utilises his own 'voice' – that of a black man of Caribbean heritage raised in the UK. This includes features of his accent and rhythms of his speech patterns. One example is in replacing 'the' with 'de.' He also replaces the pronoun 'you' with the sharper 'yu' or 'u'. The heavier 'd' and 'u' sounds add more of a stress to the beat throughout the poem. The inclusion of these features also helps to bring the speaker's voice to life, giving the poem its power and authenticity.

**Quote:** "Yu mean when light an shadow  
Mix in de sky"

**Refrain** – The speaker repeats the phrase 'Explain yuself/ wha yu mean/When you say half caste' at several points throughout the poem. This assertive demand (using an imperative verb) forces the reader to reflect on the meaning of the term that they use so flippantly towards the speaker. In the final refrain, the speaker drops the final line – suggesting an increase in his aggression – his patience towards those who use the term appears to be wearing thin.

**Quote:** "Explain yuself  
Wha yu mean"

**Puns** – Agard uses several puns throughout the poem to show his wit and intelligence – thus offering the perfect reprisal to those who imply (through their use of the term) that he is in some way 'half.' One example is between lines 12 and 21, in which the speaker plays with the word 'caste' to mock the 'overcast' British weather. Later in the poem, the speaker uses the word 'cast' once more to describe how the shadows are projected by a 'half-caste human being.'

**Quote:** "I half-caste human being  
Cast half-a-shadow"

**Form** – The poem is a monologue read by a single character – it appears to be the voice of Agard himself. There are four stanzas, with a refrain that breaks the poem up into sections. The poem does not adopt a strict rhyme scheme, but occasional rhymes add to the Caribbean-style rhythm, which is emphasised by a heavily-stressed rhythm throughout.

**Quote:** "An mix a black key  
Wid a white key"

**Structure** – The poem appears to be split into two main halves. In the opening half of the poem, Agard uses a range of humerous analogies to show that the word 'half-caste' has no meaning. In the second half of the poem, the speaker sarcastically discusses being half a person. He ends by asking the reader to use their 'whole mind' before addressing him.

**Quote:** "An de whole of yu ear  
And de whole of yu mind"

## Themes
**A theme is an idea or message that runs throughout a text.**

**Racism** – The poem is about the racist attitudes that held by people in the British society in which the speaker lives. It is demonstrated that many of these stereotypes and prejudices are so deeply engrained in people's minds that they do not even realise their racism. The speaker reveals how he longs to be recognised as a whole person – not 'half caste.'

**Divisions** – The speaker presents a society that is divided, and in which there is animosity towards one another from two opposing sides. By juxtaposing white and black language and ideas together throughout the entirety of the poem, the poet is able to highlight the gulf that people create between themselves and others in society.

# NO PROBLEM KNOWLEDGE ORGANISER

## Context

**No Problem** was written by Benjamin Zephaniah in 1996.

**Benjamin Zephaniah** – Benjamin Zephaniah (born 1958) is a British writer and dub poet. He was born and raised in Birmingham, which he has called 'The Jamaican capital of Europe.' His father was Barbadian, and his mother Jamaican. Zephaniah is dyslexic, and left an 'approved school' (a boarding school for unruly children) unable to read or write. His poetry largely focuses on social and racial issues, and is inspired by the music and poetry of Jamaica.

**Dub Poetry** – Most of Zephaniah's work is described as dub poetry, a form of oral performance poetry that is sometimes recited alongside music. This type of poetry typically draws on the rhythms and rhetoric of reggae music. Often, these poems are used to highlight social or political causes. Zephaniah's poems often deal with ideas of institutionalized racism. Despite their often serious message, many of Zephaniah's dub poems contain hope or humour.

**Racism in the UK** – The United Kingdom is a multi-cultural society, largely owing to its imperialist past, and more recent waves of immigration. As a result of preconceived attitudes linked to these historical circumstances, the extent and targets of racism in the country have altered over time. Racism is also fueled by attitudes linked to the entrenched historical class system. The UK has never implemented any laws that officially discriminate against or segregate people of minorities – however, it is only as recently as the 1960s that the first laws were introduced to actively oppose racism. Racist incidences appear to have a correlation with economic and political developments, for example in times of high unemployment or recession. Some recent studies have shown that racism is again on the rise in the UK, with nearly a third of those polled admitting that they are racially prejudiced. Events such as Brexit and the rise in popularism have been noted as possible influences for these trends. In the past, racism in the UK has resulted in riots and even murders.

## Language/Structural Devices

**Alliteration, Sibilance and 'Beat'** – Alliteration is used in several places across the poem, particularly of heavy 'p', 'b' and 'd' sounds. This helps to add a beat throughout the poem, creating a more pronounced rhythm and flow – this helps the poem to mirror music popular in the Caribbean. These heavier sounds (for example in line 2: 'But I bear de brunt') also presents a personality of toughness and defiance. Furthermore, the repetition of 's' in 'silly playground taunts/ an racist stunts' creates sibilance implying inner frustration.

> "But I bear de brunt  
> Of the silly playground taunts"

**Refrain** – The speaker repeats the opening phrase 'I am not de problem' at several points throughout the poem. This assertive declaration forces the reader to reflect on the prejudices that exist in society, in which minority groups may be identified as 'the problem.' The speaker's true message is revealed in the final utterance of the refrain, marginally altered to state 'black is not de problem' – highlighting how skin colour is not a fair indicator of a person's character.

> "I am not de problem  
> If yu give I a chance"

**Form** – The poem is a monologue read by a single character – it appears to be the voice of Zephaniah himself. There are only two stanzas, but the refrain breaks the poem up into further sections. The poem generally employs A-B-C-B rhyme scheme, which is occasionally held by half-rhymes. The rhyme and line length creates a rhythm consistent with dub poetry.

> "If you give I a chance…  
> …I can do more than dance."

**Colloquial Language, Accent and Slang** – Perhaps the most striking aspect of the poem is that Zephaniah utilises his own 'voice' – that of a black man of Jamaican heritage raised in the UK. This includes features of his accent and rhythms of his speech patterns. One example is in replacing 'the' with 'de.' He also replaces the pronouns 'they' and 'you' with 'dey' and 'yu' – the heavier 'd' and 'u' sounds this creates adds more emphasis to the beat. The inclusion of these features helps to give the poem its power and authenticity.

> "I am not de problem  
> But I bear de brunt"

**Idioms** – The speaker utilises several commonplace British idioms throughout the poem. Idioms are terms in which the meaning is not deducible from the individual word meanings. They are often old terms, from a time in which word meanings different. The speaker employs several of these, for example 'pigeon hole' and 'chip on my shoulder' to demonstrate how unfathomable some of the prejudicial, long outdated views towards black people are.

> "An I am positively sure  
> I have no chips on my shoulders"

**Structure** – Each section of the poem is led by the refrain 'I am not de problem?' (or in the final case, 'Black is not de problem'). The first stanza is largely jovial, mockingly referring to some of the stereotypical attitudes that he has had to contend with. The second stanza is slightly more serious, and reveals the key message about British society.

> "Black is not de problem  
> Mother country get it right."

As a result, he is now 'athletic' – again this is a stereotype implying that all black people are seen as fast runners.</td>

# Poppies by Jane Weir KNOWLEDGE ORGANISER

## Context
**Poppies** was written by Jane Weir, and was published in *The Guardian* in 2009.

### Jane Weir
Jane Weir was born in 1963, to a British mother and an Italian father. She spent her childhood growing up in both Italy and northern England. She also lived in Northern Ireland during the troubled 1980s, which allowed her to continue to take in different cultures and traditions. *Poppies* was written after Carol Ann Duffy asked Jane Weir (and other poets) to compose poems to raise awareness of the mistreatment and deaths of British soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq.

### Armistice Day
Armistice Day is celebrated every year on 11th November, in order to celebrate the Armistice signed by the Allies of World War I and Germany. It took place on the '11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, in 1918. The date also coincides with Remembrance Day (UK) and Veterans Day (US). In Britain, many people attend an 11am ceremony held at the Cenotaph in London – an event that is organised by the Royal British Legion, a charity devoted to continuing the memory of those who served in WWI and all subsequent wars.

### Poppies
Poppies are a type of flowering plant that have become known as a symbol of remembrance for military personnel killed serving the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in war. Small artificial poppies are traditionally worn in these countries in the lead up to Remembrance/Armistice Day. The poppy as a symbol of remembrance was first inspired by the WWI poem 'In Flanders Fields', which describes how poppies were the first flowers to grow in the fields churned up by soldiers' graves.

### The Iraq/ Afghanistan Conflicts
The War in Afghanistan began in 2001 after 9/11, when USA and its allies invaded Afghanistan in order to rid the country of Al-Qaeda, through removing the Taliban from power. The Iraq war began in 2003, when a United States-led government invaded Iraq in order to overthrow Saddam Hussein. In both wars, the power vacuum that resulted from removing these powers meant that the coalition troops faced several years in battle against insurgents, in which many were killed.

## Language/Structural Devices

### Imagery
Weir uses imagery to accentuate the contrast between the horrific manner in which the son has assumedly died, and the comforts of home. For example, the use of the term 'Sellotape Bandaged' causes the reader to consider a battlefield injury, whilst on another level gives a more comforting image of a mother cleaning cat hairs off her son's blazer. The same is true of her pinning the poppy on her son, a nurturing image which is contrasted with the words 'spasm' and 'red', presenting the idea of a horrific, violent death.

**Quote:** "I pinned one onto your lapel, crimped petals, spasms of paper red, disrupting a blockade"

### Metaphors
Figurative language is highly prevalent throughout the poem, particularly from the third stanza onward. For example, the door to the house represents the door to the world. The release of the songbird symbolises the narrator letting go of something that has given her joy. Furthermore, the dove represents the symbol of peace – showing the narrator that their son is now at peace.

**Quote:** "After you'd gone I went into your bedroom, released a song bird from its cage."

### Form/Structure
At first glance, the poem appears to have a strong, regular form. There are four stanzas – the first and last have 6 lines, whilst the middle stanzas have 11 and 12. But, a closer look reveals that 19 of the 35 lines in the poem have breaks in the middle. This is suggestive of a narrator that is trying to keep calm, but is breaking down inside.

**Quote:** "play at/being Eskimos like we did when you were little/ I resisted the impulse"

### Varied Verbs
A wide range of verbs are used to demonstrate the manner in which actions are carried out – this helps to carry the tone and key messages of the poem. For example, the narrator reminisces about fond memories from the past, using positive verbs such as 'play' and 'smoothed.' Verbs used to describe their interactions in the present all offer connotations of pain and discomfort, e.g. 'flattened,' 'pinned', and 'graze.' The variation in these verbs helps to form the sharp contrasts that shape the poem.

**Quote:** "All my words flattened, rolled, turned into felt,"

### Interesting Adjectives
Weir uses few adjectives throughout the poem (largely in keeping with its simple and sombre tone) but those that are included are hugely descriptive. For example, the use of the adjective 'intoxicated' gives the reader a depth of understanding about both the son's mindset heading into war (enthusiastic) and the narrator's trepidation regarding the son's mindset.

**Quote:** "A split second and you were away, intoxicated."

### Narrative Structure
The time sequence throughout the poem changes along with the narrator's emotions. The reader is led through the time sequence from 'three days before' (line 1), 'before you left' (3), 'after you'd gone' (23), to 'this is where it has led me' (25). At the end of the poem, the narrator finds themselves caught between the past and the present.

**Quote:** "and this is where it has led me, skirting the church yard walls, my stomach busy"

## Themes

### Remembrance
The theme of remembrance is particularly eminent throughout the poem – as expected from the title (poppies are a symbol of remembrance) and the 1st line (Armistice Day is a day in which people lost in war are remembered. The narrator in this poem recalls with fondness memories from her son's childhood.

### Loss and Suffering
Like many other war and conflict poems, the poem deals with the themes of loss and suffering. However, in this case, the poem is told from a unique perspective: not from those who are present or are reporting on war, but the sense of loss and suffering felt by those left behind – the secondary victims of war.

## The Poet's Influences

The poem came out of sadness and anger, the two emotions combined, and it was written quickly, which is fairly unusual...At the time the news was full of conflict; Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, and of course we'd had the Balkans, and various 'tribal wars' in Africa....

We very rarely hear the women speak. I have two sons myself and I'd read in the newspapers, seen on TV the verdicts from the inquests on soldiers killed in Iraq. Who could forget the harrowing testimonies of the soldiers families, and in particular their Mothers...and I was angry and frustrated at the apathy, or what I perceived as 'voicelessness' and ability to be heard or get any kind of justice. I wanted to write a poem from the point of view of a mother and her relationship with her son, a child who was loved cherished and protected... and it had led to this.... heightened and absolute fear that parents experience in letting their children go, the anxiety and ultimately the pain of loss...

# The Charge of the Light Brigade KNOWLEDGE ORGANISER

## Context – The Charge of the Light Brigade was written by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, in 1854

**Alfred, Lord Tennyson** – Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809-1892) was a poet, whose work remains popular today. Many phrases from his work have become commonplace in English today. He was one of 11 children, and received a good literary education. He began publishing poems whilst still a student at Cambridge. In 1850, he became Poet Laureate, writing poems on matters of national importance until his death in 1892.

**Attitudes to War** – Public perceptions of war have significantly altered since Lord Tennyson's era, owing largely to the horrendous impact of WWI, WWII and the Vietnam War. Many at the time felt that war was worthwhile and glorious, and that there was no honour greater than dying for one's country. Whilst Tennyson was predominantly against the idea of war (the poem shows disgust for the treatment of soldiers), he presents that taking orders and dying for one's country is honourable.

**The Crimean War** – The Crimean War was a military conflict fought between 1853 and 1856, in which the Russian Empire lost to an alliance of France, Britain, the Ottoman Empire, and Sardinia. The causes for the war are notoriously blurry, however relate to a reluctance to allow Russia to gain land during the Ottoman decline. Despite these unclear intentions, it has become known for its bloodiness and catastrophic mismanagement.

**The Battle of Balaclava** – The Battle of Balaclava was fought on 25th October 1854 as a part of the Crimean War. During this battle, 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' took place. The cavalry were intended to be sent to prevent Russians from removing captured guns, however a miscommunication resulted in them charging directly at an artillery battery, surrounded, and under withering direct fire. They reached the battery, but high casualties forced them to quickly retreat.

<td>A 'league' is an old way to measure distance, equating to around 3 miles. The repetition of this commences a rolling rhythm that continues through the poem, resembling the sound of horses' hooves galloping. Tennyson uses a metaphor in describing the opposition-dominated battlefield as 'the valley of death.' This has religious connotations (Psalm 23). 'Light' brigade is in opposition to the 'heavy' artillery, and yet they are being asked to 'Charge for the guns!' It is assumed 'he' refers to the commander.</td>

The poet uses a rhetorical question to question the sense of the order – yet affirms that the soldiers carried out the order even though they knew there had been a mistake (someone had blundered). The anaphora involving the lines beginning 'theirs' is representative of some form of chant or recitation, thus adopting the voice of the soldiers – it is not their place to answer back or question, just to 'do and die' (follow orders knowing that they will likely die). The last two lines are repeated (a refrain) to emphasise the main action of the poem – the 600 men charging in.</td>

The use of varied verbs (volleyed and thundered) creates the reverberating sound of the cannons firing, whilst the alliterative use of the 's' sound in 'stormed at with shot and shell' reflects the viciousness of the attack that they face. The adverb 'boldly' reflects their undeterred demeanour, even though the extension of the metaphor (becoming the 'jaws of death') makes this appear more and more like a suicide mission.</td>

<td>Sabres are the type of curved sword that these type of cavalrymen would have been carrying. Remember that they are charging into gunfire, and yet they themselves are not armed with guns. The repetition of sabre/sabring highlights the deficit that they hold. However, 'flashed' gives the idea of being proud and imperious, even in the face of such danger. Tennyson once more uses alliteration, this time of the 'w' sound in 'all the world wondered.' In this case wondered means they were filled with awe, and the repeated 'wo' sounds reflect the voices of those reading about the story around the world. The Light Brigade is able to break through the enemy line –a big achievement. They are then forced to retreat, but it is clear that some have died.</td>

Note the use of rhyme in this stanza, stressing 'shell, 'fell', 'hell' and 'well.' These four words alone emphasise how horrific and dangerous the battle was, yet how the Light Brigade fought strongly and were prepared to die for their country in the face of it. The 'jaws of death' metaphor had suggested certain death, and yet 'what was left of them' rode back out – thus demonstrating their achievement against the odds.

## Language/Structural Devices

**Rhetorical Questions/ Imperative Verbs** – Tennyson makes smart use of rhetorical questions and imperative verbs to both encourage the reader to think deeply about the situation, and to gain exert authority over how the reader should react to the poem. For example, the rhetorical question 'was there a man dismayed?' manipulates the reader into considering that there was a good cause to be upset about the order. Furthermore, the imperative verb 'honour' tells the reader exactly how they should think of the soldiers.

> Quote: "Honour the charge they made!
> Honour the Light Brigade."

**Metaphors** – The predominant metaphor used throughout the poem compares the battleground to the 'valley of death', and an extension of this (as the soldiers reach the opposition battery) is the jaws of death. This creates a sense of ominous certainty that the men will perish when they enter. This makes the return of a number of them seem all the more remarkable.

> Quote: "Into the valley of Death
> Rode the six hundred."

**Form/Structure** – The poem is composed of six stanzas which vary in length from six to twelve lines. Each of the stanzas shares similarities, for example ending with the refrain 'six hundred', thus emphasising the most important message in the poem. The poem also makes use of anaphora (the same words repeated at the beginning of lines).

> Quote: "Cannon to right of them / Cannon to left of them /
> Cannon in front of them."

**Alliteration** – A range of alliteration is used throughout the poem to recreate the sounds that the soldiers hear in the battlefield environment. There is a visceral effect, for example, that is created when the reader traverses the line 'stormed at with shot and shell:' The repeated 's' sound replicating the violence of the moment. Alliteration is also utilised to capture the reactions of the world to the event – the repeated 'wo' sound in 'All the world wondered' depicting the astonishment of those reading about the battle.

> Quote: "Charging an army, while
> All the world wondered."

**Varied Verbs** – Tennyson uses some interesting and original verbs to portray the actions, sights, and sounds on the battlefield. For example, the artillery is described using the words 'volleyed', 'thundered', and 'stormed.' Such powerful verbs make the artillery seem like an almighty force of nature (note the connotations of violent weather), something far bigger and stronger than the Light Brigade.

> Quote: "Volleyed and thundered;
> Stormed at with shot and shell"

**Rhythm/Rhyme** – The poem is written in dimeter – meaning that there are two stressed syllables per line. These are usually followed by at least two unstressed syllables, creating the sound of Light Brigade riding into battle on horseback. The use of sporadic rhyme further strengthens this rhythm, creating a flow to the poem as it is read aloud.

> Quote: "Flashed all their sabres bare / Flashed as they
> turned in air / Sab'ring the gunners there."

## Themes – A theme is an idea or message that runs throughout a text.

**Remembrance** – Tennyson's predominant aim in the poem is to create a lasting memory of the bravery of the anonymous men in the Light Brigade. Clear respect is shown for the men throughout the entirety of the poem, but the clear attempts to cement their legacy come in the 2nd half, through vocabulary such as 'hero' and 'glory.'

**The Futility of War** – Whilst Tennyson's poem conforms to the idea that death for one's country in war is deemed 'honourable', it also shows thinly veiled disgust at the treatment of the men in the Light Brigade. This is most evident in the lines ' though the soldier knew/ Someone had blundered.'

## The Poet's Influences

**FROM THE TIMES, OCTOBER 25th, 1854:** If the exhibition of the most brilliant valour, of the excess of courage… I shall proceed to describe, to the best of my power, what occurred under my own eyes, and to state the facts which I have heard from men whose veracity is unimpeachible, reserving to myself the right of private judgement in making public and in surpressing the details of what occurred on this memorable day … At11:00 our Light Cavalry Brigade rushed to the front... The Russians opened on them with guns from the redoubts on the right, with volleys of musketry and rifles. They swept proudly past, glittering in the morning sun in all the pride and splendor of war. We could hardly believe the evidence of our senses. Surely that handful of men were not going to charge an army in position? Alas! It was but too true -- their desperate valour knew no bounds, and far indeed was it removed from its so-called better part -- discretion. They advanced in two lines, quickening the pace as they closed towards the enemy.

THE CLASS GAME KNOWLEDGE ORGANISER

## Context

**The Class Game** was written by Mary Casey, and was first published in *Voices* in 1979.

**Mary Casey** – Little is known about Mary Casey, except that she was a housewife from Liverpool. Casey contributed to a magazine called *Voices*, which existed between 1972 and 1984. In *Voices*, poets from working class backgrounds, who had no literary background or published works. They were just ordinary working-class people, writing about everyday experiences. 'The Class Game' was one of four of Casey's poems that appeared in the magazine.

**Voices Magazine** – *Voices* magazine was initiated in 1972 in order to give those from working classes a literary voice. Based in Manchester, the journal ran for around 12 years. However, there was a rather snobby critical response to the poems in the journal. Even the academic who started the magazine, Ben Ainsley, wrote in the introduction that he 'could make no great claims for these pieces' insinuating that he held doubts regarding the literary value of the work.

**Liverpool in the 1970s and 1980s** – Liverpool was a working class city that suffered particularly badly throughout the recession of the 1970s and 1980s. There were high levels of unemployment (later exacerbated by the policies of Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government). There was a vast gulf between the lives enjoyed by the rich and the existence suffered by the poor. Such disparities caused anger, which led to anger on the streets of the city throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s.

**The U.K's historical class system** – Although the class system was less formalised than in earlier history, class divisions still separated different people in society from one another. Society was made up of wealthy, noble families, middle classes, and working classes, and social mobility (particularly in the recession). Large social and cultural divides still existed, alienating people from one another, and creating a dangerous environment in which anger was able to breed.

## Language/Structural Devices

**Metaphor and Simile** – In the quest for a simple, 'down-to-earth' tone, Casey uses figurative language sparingly. However, a metaphor is used when the speaker accuses posh people of speaking with an 'Olly (plum) in their mouths. Such a metaphor is used to represent the deliberate, mannered speech used by people perceived as being posh. Towards the end of the poem, Casey inverts this metaphor with the simile 'stick in your gullet like a sour plum' showing the discomfort of the middle classes in the presence of the working classes.

> Quote: "Why do you care what class I'm from?  
> Does it stick in your gullet like a sour plum?"

**Refrain** – The speaker repeats the opening question 'How can you tell what class I'm from?' at several points throughout the poem. This challenging question addresses the reader directly through the use of the personal pronoun 'you', forcing them to reflect on their prejudice through its rhetorical nature. The speaker's true message is revealed in the final utterance of the refrain, as it is marginally altered to ask 'why do you care what class I'm from?'

> Quote: "How can you tell what class I'm from?  
> I can talk posh like some"

**Form** – The poem is a monologue read by a single character – it is ambiguous as to whether this is the voice of Casey herself. There is only one stanza, but the refrain breaks the poem up into sections. The poem generally employs rhyming couplets, (A-A-B-B) but this is often held by half-rhymes, and at times (particularly the beginning) the rhythm is uncertain.

> Quote: "Or did I drop my unemployment card  
> Sitting on your patio (We have a yard)?"

**Colloquial Language and Slang** – Informal language is utilised across the poem to mirror the dialect of the working class speaker. For example, Liverpudlian terms such as 'corpy' (council housing) and 'wet nelly' (a type of pudding) show the speaker's pride in their distinct regional dialect. Non-standard grammatical forms – e.g. 'tara' and 'me tea' are also used throughout. Some colloquialisms, for example 'bog', 'pee', and 'bum' seem to be used in attempt to shock or offend the middle class reader.

> Quote: "So why do you always wince when you hear  
> Me say 'Tara' to me 'Ma' instead of 'Bye Mummy dear'?"

**Imagery** – The imagery in the poem serves to compare life for the working and middle classes. One key image is given presenting two types of hands. The working class hands are portrayed as rough and weathered - 'stained with toil', whilst the middle class hands are described as being far more cared-for - 'soft lily white from perfume and oil.' Another vivid image is given of the council housing in Liverpool, in comparison to the 'pretty little semi' out in the Wirral.

> Quote: "Or is it because my hands are stained with toil?  
> Instead of soft lily-white with perfume and oil?"

**Structure** – Each section of the poem is led by the refrain 'How can you tell what class I'm from?' (or in the final case, a variant of this). There is a question/ answer structure used throughout – likely to encourage the reader to reflect on why they play the class game themselves. The final line reveals the poet's true message – they are proud of being working class.

> Quote: "And me stomach is me belly  
> And I'm proud of the class that I come from."

## Themes

**A theme is an idea or message that runs throughout a text.**

**Class** – The poem is about the class divisions that exist in society, and the games that we play when we make judgements about others, or present ourselves in ways that we wish others to see us. The speaker lists several means by which her class is judged, including her accent, her vocabulary, and her father's employment position.

**Divisions** – The speaker presents a society that is divided, and in which there is animosity towards one another from two opposing sides. By juxtaposing working class and middle class ideas together throughout the entirety of the poem, the poet is able to vividly highlight the differences between the two classes.

# THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB KNOWLEDGE ORGANISER

## Context

*The Destruction of Sennacherib* was written by Lord Byron and published in 1815.

**Lord Byron** – George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron (1788-1824) was a leading poet in the romantic movement, in addition to being a politician, nobleman and peer. Byron is amongst the most popular and wide-read British poets. He is known as one of the most flamboyant and notorious of the major Romantic poets. Throughout his life, Byron travelled extensively, particularly throughout Italy. He was good friends with Percy Bysshe Shelley. In later life, Byron fought for the Ottoman Empire in the Greek War of Independence.

**Byron's Personal Life** – Byron was both celebrated and condemned in his life for his aristocratic excesses, which included numerous love affairs (with men and women), amassing huge debts, and being involved in scandalous rumours. It is not difficult to imagine that his many love interests influenced both the content and the style of his poetry. He was described by one contemporary as 'mad, bad and dangerous to know.' In addition to a number of illegitimate children, Byron had one legitimate child: Ada Lovelace (pictured).

**The Biblical Story** – *The Destruction of Sennacherib* is based on a short biblical story. In the story, the powerful, wealthy Assyrian leader Sennacherib brings a vast army to conquer the holy city of Jerusalem. Despite commanding around 185,000 fierce Assyrian soldiers, the army was annihilated, seemingly by God himself, who went forth and 'smote' the camp of the Assyrians in the night. Whilst Sennacherib survived the attack, he lost respect. He never dared to attack Jerusalem again and was later murdered by two of his own sons.

**Romanticism** – Romanticism was an artistic, literary, musical, cultural and intellectual movement that originated in Europe in the latter half of the 18th Century (peaking in the early 19th Century). Romanticism is characterised by its emphasis on emotions, glorifying nature and past events – memories and settings are often colourfully described. It was partially in response to the scientific rationalisation of nature of the era. Aside from Lord Byron, amongst the most famous romantic poets were William Wordsworth and Percy Bysshe Shelley.

However, in death they are described as 'withered' and 'strown' like 'the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath blown.'

## Language/Structural Devices

**Similes** – Byron also employs a number of similes throughout the poem, often comparing the subjects within the poem to natural elements. For example, in the opening line, the Assyrian is compared to the 'wolf', no doubt a reference to the invaders' aggression, wiliness and ferocity. This forms a significant contrast with the later simile used to describe the Assyrians after death – 'cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.' Life and warmth has been drained from the soldiers. Similes are also utilised to compare the changing status of the soldiers to the changing of the seasons – moving like the leaves of the forest when 'Summer is green' at sunset, and like the leaves of the forest when 'Autumn hath blown' by the morning.

**Quote:** "The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold/ And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;"

**Quote:** "Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green, That host with their banners at sunset were seen:"

**Interesting Verbs** – Varied, interesting verbs show the contrast between the actions of the Assyrians on the way to battle, and their inactivity once dead. Verbs such as 'gleaming' and 'roll' depict the army's wealth and huge numbers, making it seem formidable. However verbs such as 'unlifted' and 'unblown' later accentuate their stillness and silence after being killed by the Angel of Death.

**Quote:** "And the tents were all silent, the banners alone, The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown."

**Form** – The poem is written in quatrains using a distinctive rhythm, which creates an upbeat, vibrant poem, quite at odds with its deathly content. This helps to underline the contrast between the might of the army and the tragedy of its death. There are six stanzas, each of which contain two pairs of rhyming couplets, creating an AABB rhyme scheme– this could be to echo the horses marching into battle.

**Quote:** "And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword, Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord!"

**Archaic Language** – Some of the vocabulary and syntax choices are deliberately old-fashioned, in order to echo the language and sentence style of the bible. For example, word choices such as 'strown' and 'wax'd' would have been old-fashioned even in Byron's time. 'Their hearts heaved once' would have been more standard than 'Their hearts but once heaved.' This helps to create a sense of the time and place.

**Quote:** "And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill/ And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still!"

**Alliteration** – The subtle use of alliteration adds to the sound imagery in some of the poem's descriptions. For example, the repetition of the 's' sound in the "sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea" creates a hissing sound that brings a suggestion of evil. Furthermore, the repeated 'h' sound in 'their hearts but once heaved' slows down the reading at the moment in which the soldiers' lives are ended.

**Quote:** "And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea/ When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee."

## Themes

*A theme is an idea or message that runs throughout a text.*

**Good vs. Evil** – The poem presents good and evil as two different sides. Evil is represented as early as the first line, as the Assyrians are described as being 'the wolf on the fold.' The Assyrians' lavish luxuries and idols are presented in a negative light, whilst the actions of God against them are presented as being pure and natural.

**The Power of Nature/ God** – God is shown to have the power to protect his people in times of need. His power is shown through the forces of nature. The might of the Assyrian army is shown to be nothing in the face of God – he merely has to 'glance' at them in order to allow nature to take its course on their bodies, rendering them lifeless.

## Wider Reading

"In the summer, Murray brought out the poetry separately as Hebrew Melodies. Despite the high price of one guinea for a thin folio, the work sold ten thousand copies in two editions. Despite the title of the volume, some of Byron's contributions are not at all Hebrew (or even religious) in theme. Along with verses inspired by the Old Testament are love songs and reflective pieces, some written before the book's conception, though in their expressions of sadness, longing, and desolation, they voice sentiments found in the biblical poems bewailing the lost Jewish homeland." www.poetryfoundation.org

# The Man He Killed KNOWLEDGE ORGANISER

## Context

*The Man He Killed* was written by Thomas Hardy in 1902.

**Thomas Hardy** – Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) was a Victorian novelist and poet, who mixed elements of realism and romanticism in his writing. His works were highly critical of much in Victorian society – many of his novels and poems contain tragic characters who struggle against both their emotions and social circumstances. Like many liberals of the time, Hardy was openly against the Second Boer War, which Britain was fighting at the time the poem was written.

**The Victorian Era** – The Victorian era describes the period in which Queen Victoria sat on the English throne – between 1837 and 1901 (most of Hardy's life). Whilst this was a time of industrial revolution, it was also an extremely harsh time to live, and the differences between the lives of the richest and the poorest were exacerbated. The poor lived in danger and poverty on a daily basis, and Hardy was a vocal critic of these inequalities.

**The Boer Wars** – The Boer Wars were a series of wars fought between the British Empire and two Boer states (the South African Republic and Orange in Free State) in the area now known as South Africa. As with many wars fought throughout the late 19th Century, the British fought in order to consolidate their empire. Initially, the Boer side fought effectively using guerilla attacks, until harsh British counter-measures forced the Boer leaders to yield.

**Attitudes Towards War and Empire** – Earlier in the 19th Century, Britain's empirical actions and wars had generally been viewed with patriotic pride by most public figures. However, around the turn of the 20th Century, many were beginning to question the morality and ethics of these policies. The Boer War was one of the first examples of a conflict in which British public opinion was not wholly supportive.

The final line of the stanza is particularly powerful – 'no other reason why' on the surface level refers to their reason for joining the war (not out of personal/ political beliefs or hatred for the other).

## Language/Structural Devices

**Simple Language** – The predominant feature of the language used across the poem is that it is extremely simple and matter-of-fact. This reflects the speaker's background and character: a working class, 'everyday' man. It is important that these common features of the speaker and the man he killed are understood by the reader, in order to get across the message that regular people are being placed into these horrific situations. Simple language is perhaps most evident in the short description of the killing – emotions and embellishment are left out, as the man has to do in his role.

> Quote: "I shot at him as he at me,  
> And killed him in his place."

**Colloquialisms** – Alongside the absence of colourful figurative language, the inclusion of colloquial terms further enables the reader to view the speaker and his foe as ordinary men. A prime example is in the opening stanza, where the speaker imagines that the two would 'wet/ Right many a nipperkin', implying that in a different situation they may well drink together – 'Nipperkin' was a term most used in the West Country. Another example is in stanza 4, where the speaker suggests that the man he killed may have, like he, 'sold his traps' (his belongings). These colloquialisms helps to further contextualise the speaker and foe as common men, building their connection to the reading public, thus aiding Hardy's message.

> Quote: "We should have sat us down to wet  
> Right many a nipperkin!"

**Enjambment/ Caesura** – Enjambment and caesura are used to affect the rhythm and pace of the poem, and to emphasise meanings. For example, caesura and enjambment combine at the end of stanza 4 in order to slow the pace of the poem, and leave the reader paused on the idea of there being little reason for the two men to kill one another.

> Quote: "Was out of work — had sold his traps —  
> No other reason why."

**Repetition and Fillers** – Words are repeated, and fillers are inserted, to show the speaker struggling to think about why he had to kill the man. For example, in stanza 3, 'because' is repeated over a line break, buying the speaker thinking time. Similarly, 'although' and 'perhaps' show his hesitancy – he is clearly unsure about why he must kill.

> Quote: "I shot him dead because —  
> Because he was my foe,"

**Form** – The poem contains 5 stanzas each of which are 4 lines long, with alternating rhyme in an ABAB pattern. There is also a regular metre: the first, second and fourth line of every stanza are around 6 syllables long, whilst the third line is slightly longer at around 8 syllables. This rigid structure can be seen to represent the regimented lives and strict orders that the men face in their lives as soldiers at war.

> Quote: "Had he and I met/ By some old ancient inn"

**Structure** – The poem is a dramatic monologue, which moves to and from the friendly idea of two men drinking together in a public house, to one brutally killing each other on a battlefield. There appears to be a slow realization (marked by the caesura) throughout chapters 3 and 4 that the man killed was in fact not an enemy. Stanza 5 sums up the futility of war and its effect on those doing the fighting.

> Quote: "Yes; quaint and curious war is!  
> You shoot a fellow down"

## Themes

A theme is an idea or message that runs throughout a text.

**The Futility of War** – The poem has a strong anti-war message, as the reasons for killing the man are exposed to be weak. The speaker knows that he is the man's 'foe' but he cannot fathom why. This serves to demonstrate the stupidity of war, in which men kill exterminate each other's lives merely because they are told to. The inclusion of 'everyday' ideas and colloquialisms (inn, nipperkin) show that this it is ordinary people who are affected.

**Dehumanisation** – Neither the speaker nor the man that he killed are given a name – their identity has been removed. This represents the idea that they do not matter to those in power. The fourth stanza suggests that the men are working class; they have more in common with each other than with those who command them.

## Poems for Comparison

**Exposure** - *The Man He Killed* can be compared with this poem in relation to the theme of The Futility of War

**What Were they Like?** - *Eden Rock* can be contrasted with this poem in relation to the theme of Dehumanisation

## Influences on the Poet

"He had written about war long before 1914. He was fascinated by what he called 'the Great Historical Calamity, or Clash of Peoples, artificially brought about some hundred years ago'. It seemed impossible that another European upheaval could ever happen, and he agreed with Tolstoy's denunciation of war, 'with all its senseless and illogical crimes'. His sympathies were not with the generals and emperors but with the victims, the sailor taken by the press-gang or the two young men in 'The Melancholy Hussar of the German Legion' (1890) who are executed for desertion.http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/great-war/thomas-hardy-1840-1928/

# Extract from The Prelude KNOWLEDGE ORGANISER

## Context
The Prelude was originally written in 1798, but was frequently rewritten and published in 1850.

## William Wordsworth
William Wordsworth (1812-1889) is one of the most famous poets in English Literature. He was born and raised in the Lake District, a beautiful natural area of the UK which clearly influenced the subject matter and themes in his writing. After living in France for a while, returning, and then marrying, Wordsworth was made the Poet Laureate. In 1847, after the death of his daughter, Wordsworth was said to be so upset that he could no longer write poetry. He died in 1850.

### Writing the Prelude
Wordsworth began writing The Prelude in 1798, after experiencing homesickness when in Germany. It is a long autobiographical poem that is written in 14 books. It was not published until shortly after his death, in 1850. The poet uses childhood memories to share his quest for understanding in life. This extract in particular refers to a childhood memory in which he commandeers a boat before realising the magnitude and power of nature around him.

## Romanticism
Romanticism was an artistic, literary, musical, cultural and intellectual movement that originated in Europe in the latter half of the 18th Century. In most areas it peaked in the early 19th Century. Romanticism is characterised by its emphasis on emotions, as well as glorifying nature and past events – memories and settings are often colourfully described. It was partially in response to the scientific rationalisation of nature of the era.

## The Title
The full title of the poem is The Prelude: Growth of a Poet's Mind. The poem endeavours to do exactly as its subtitle implies, with each section roughly corresponding to a section in his poetic development. Wordsworth himself likened The Prelude to a Gothic cathedral, explaining (in another of his texts, The Excursion) that the poem was like 'an antechapel through which the reader might pass' in order to gain access to the main body of his work.

## Language/Structural Devices

### Imagery
Wordsworth uses vivid imagery to create the night-time atmosphere throughout the opening of the extract, using vocabulary associated with peace to describe the tranquil natural phenomena. For example, words such as 'stealth', 'idly', and 'glistening' paint a quiet, peaceful scene in the mind of the reader. This is at odds with the sinister, almost gothic-like imagery that is created in the second half of the poem through vocabulary such as 'grave', 'black' and 'grim.'

Quote: "Small circles glittering idly in the moon/ Until they melted all into one track."

### Personification
In order to demonstrate the sheer power of nature throughout the poem, Wordsworth chooses to personify several aspects of nature at different points in the extract. For example, it is initially inferred that nature itself (she) guided him to take the boat that evening. Later on in the poem, the mountain peak that so terrifies the speaker is heavily personified, for e.g. through the terms 'voluntary power instinct' and 'upreared its head' – giving it purpose.

Quote: "As if with voluntary power instinct, Upreared its head. I struck and struck again,"

### Alliteration
The repetition of particular sounds is used effectively by Wordsworth to evoke both tone and atmosphere at different points in the poem. For example, the frequent use of soft 'l' and 'm' sounds at the beginning of the poem (leaving, glittering, light, like) create a feeling of tranquility and peacefulness. This is in contrast to the ominous 'd' sound (days, dim, darkness) that dominates later.

Quote: "That spectacle, for many days, my brain Worked with a dim and undetermined sense"

### Similes/Metaphors
Wordsworth also uses a number of figurative language techniques to paint a precise image in the mind of the reader, which alters as the tone of the poem changes. For example, the boat is initially described as being like a graceful 'swan', as the speaker is content and peaceful. Later, when feeling far more vulnerable, the speaker describes their vessel as simply being 'bark.'

Quote: "And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat Went heaving through the water like a swan;"

### Oxymoron
An oxymoron is used in line six as the speaker states 'it was an act of stealth, and troubled pleasure.' Pleasure is usually something to be enjoyed, whilst someone that is 'troubled' is tormented to the degree that they cannot take pleasure from something. Whilst the boy does take pleasure from taking the boat, it is implied that he cannot enjoy it fully, for some kind of underlying fear.

Quote: "Pushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice"

### Structure
There are no stanzas throughout the extract, yet Wordsworth opts to use lots of punctuation to clarify meanings and enable the reader to separate ideas. The extract is like a complete story in itself, in that it starts with 'one summer evening' and ends with the effect of the action 'trouble to my dreams.' The repeated use of 'and' throughout the poem gives it a spoken feel, like someone telling a story.

Quote: "Like living men, moved slowly through the mind By day, and were a trouble to my dreams"

The speaker then opens themselves to all that nature has to offer, with Wordsworth using vivid imagery to describe its wonders. There is alliteration of soft 'l' and 'm' sounds, reflecting the serenity. The oxymoron 'troubled pleasure' suggests conflicted emotions - nature shows pure beauty but also power.</td>

The mention of the stars, with all their celestial beauty, and the use of the adjective 'elfin', however, point towards something more powerful and mystical. The simile comparing the boat to a swan signifies the beauty and elegance with which it moves through the water. This is a tranquil and beautiful image of nature.</td>

The peak is heavily personified, for example the suggestion that it has a 'purpose', as if it is bringing some kind of message or intent towards him and that it 'upreared its head' and was 'growing.' The separation it creates between him and the stars represents the idea that nature is standing between him and the divine – it appears stronger than him.</td>

The vocabulary used e.g. 'dim' and 'grave' give a sense of foreboding.</td>

## Themes
A theme is an idea or message that runs throughout a text.

### Nature
As the speaker realises in this extract from The Prelude, humanity is only one part of nature. The natural world can make man feel extremely small and insignificant. The speaker feels power after taking the boat and directing it as he pleases, but is soon levelled by the power of nature (in the form of a large mountain).

### Loneliness
Throughout large sections of The Prelude, Wordsworth is often on his own, and he makes it clear that this is important to him. He is able to think more clearly when he is alone, and is more affected by experiences and places. In this sense, a more spiritual and mystical atmosphere is created through the idea of loneliness.

## Poems for Comparison

### Exposure
The Prelude can be compared and contrasted with this poem through its presentation of nature.

### Poppies/ War Photographer
The Prelude can be compared and contrasted with these poems through its presentation of loneliness.

## Influences on the Poet
Many of Wordsworth's poems were influenced by his sister Dorothy, whose journal he liked to read. For example: "When we were in the woods beyond Gowbarrow Park we saw a few daffodils close to the waterside. We fancied that the lake had floated the seeds ashore, and that the little colony had so sprung up. But as we went along there were more and yet more; and at last under the boughs of the trees, we saw that there was a long belt of them along the shore, about the breadth of a country turnpike road. These beautiful descriptions of the natural surroundings were imitated in sections of Wordsworth's poems, for example 'I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud' and 'The Prelude.'

WAR PHOTOGRAPHER KNOWLEDGE ORGANISER

# WAR PHOTOGRAPHER KNOWLEDGE ORGANISER

## Context
War Photographer was written by Carole Satyamurti in 1987.

**Carole Satyamurti** – Carole Satyamurti (born 1939) is a British poet, sociologist, and translator. She is a contemporary poet who deals with painful subjects head on, for example cancer, war, and death. Indeed, many of her poems show an interest in the fragility of human life. Her poems also detail how suffering affects different people. Satyamurti has taught at both the University of East London and the Tavistock Clinic, relating psychoanalytic ideas to the stories that people tell.

**Wars at the Time** – At the time that the poem was written (in 1987) there were several major wars and conflicts going on across the world. Principal amongst these was the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-1988, in which around 1 million people died in warfare conditions described as being similar to World War I. The Soviet-Afghan War and the 1982 Lebanon War were other events that immediately preceded the writing of the poem. With the Cold War also still running, this was a worrying time.

**War Photographers** – War photography involves photographing armed conflict and the effect of this on people and places. War photographers often have to place themselves in harms way, and are sometimes injured or killed themselves attempting to capture the required images/ getting images out of the war arena. Photojournalistic tradition (and other factors, e.g. differing cultures, etc.) suggests that war photographers should not influence what is being captured.

**Dangers for War Photographers** – In the modern day, journalists and war photographers are protected by the international conventions of armed warfare, yet are still often considered targets by opposing groups. Sometimes this is the case in order for a group to show their hatred of the other, whilst in other cases photographers are targeted to prevent the facts from being widely shared. For example, in the Iraqi War between 2003 and 2009, 36 photographers were abducted or killed.

This is not the case for the war photographer, who experiences the place for real. Lines 2 and 3 suggest that the reader can convince themselves that the world around the image is normal, and that the 'tragic' is something that the photographer has needed to seek out 'to make a subject.' However, the use of the modal verb 'can' suggests that this is not the truth. The final lines of the stanza deal with the opposite, how people are convinced that the world is fine by poems that 'lifts the heart.' The true experience remains with the photographer.</td>

This appears to be the truth that the public wants to hear.

## Language/Structural Devices

**Enjambment and Caesura** – Enjambment and caesura serve to speed up slow down, link and break up different sections of the poem. The heavy use of enjambment and caesura throughout creates a sense of unease – the unsteady flow of the poem makes the reader more insecure and apprehensive, mirroring the feelings of those caught in the conflict. Caesura and enjambment also combine to create a sense of being cut off. The caesura in line 23 after 'almost-smile' suggests that her happiness has been cut off.

**Quote:** "The picture showed the little mother the almost-smile. Their caption read"

**Extended Metaphor** – An extended metaphor runs throughout the poem which compares the photographer/ reader to predators and the girl victim in the war to prey. Several language choices aid this depiction. For example, the speaker describes how they 'seek out' and 'follow' the girl, before waiting with 'finger pressed.' She is described like some fleeing animal, through vocabulary such as 'fleeing', 'scream' and 'run.' This helps to show her desperate situation.

**Quote:** "Instinct prevailing, she dropped her burden and, mouth too small for her dark scream,"

**Form** – The poem is a monologue read by a single character – the war photographer. There are five stanzas, each of which are between 4 and 8 lines long. The first and last paragraphs are longer. Some lines appear to be cut drastically short, perhaps representing the key message - that the photographer's photos only tell a part of the story.

**Quote:** "But hell' like heaven, is untidy, its boundaries"

**Imagery** – Satyamurti uses a clever range of vocabulary to create vivid images in the mind of the reader. These are often juxtaposed together to accentuate their effect. For example, in stanza 2, Satyamurti describes a 'pair of peach, sun-gilded girls' – the sun represents happiness and health, whilst the 'champagne' that they drink and their 'silk' clothes portray wealth. The 'grass' that they lay on is juxtaposed in the next stanza with the 'devastated street' which the small girl is 'staggering' down. The reader is jarred by the contrast.

**Quote:** "rolling, silk crumpled, on the grass… … staggering down some devastated street"

**Sibilance** – Sibilance is used for contrasting effects throughout stanzas 2 and 3. In stanza 2, the repetition of the 's' sound in 'silk crumpled, on the grass, in champagne giggles' echoes the soft of hiss of the champagne fizzing, or even the light-hearted giggling of the girls. In stanza 3, on the other hand, it is used to show how sinister and evil war is. It may also perhaps represent the whistling of falling bombs, and sounds of objects shattering around the landscape.

**Quote:** "staggering down some devastated street, she saw me seeing her; my finger pressed."

**Structure** – The poem begins in the present tense, as if the photographer is confessing the false nature of her profession. The following stanzas are in the past tense. Stanza 2 describes happy ascot girls, which is juxtaposed in stanza 3 with the girl in a war torn country. In stanza 4, she drops the baby in her care as she flees. Stanza 5 summarises the key message.

**Quote:** "The reassurance of the frame is flexible - you can think that just outside it"

## Themes
A theme is an idea or message that runs throughout a text.

**Suffering** – Satyamurti exposes the true horrors of war, which exist beyond the images seen in the media. In order to exemplify the true suffering that people experience, Satyamurti details a young girl who is forced to drop a baby and run when bombs go off nearby. This image is contrasted by the relative joy of the 'sun-gilded' ascot girls.

**Ignorance** – The speaker seeks to clarify the real nature of war and conflict to the ignorant viewing public. In the opening stanza, the speaker reveals how the reader can dismiss horrors that exist within the frame of a photo as little more than a faraway story. The war photographer, however, is acutely aware of the real horrors of war.

## Poems for Comparison

**Exposure** - War Photographer can be compared and contrasted with this poem in relation to the theme of **Suffering**.

**What Were They Like?** - No Problem can be compared and contrasted with this poem in the approach to the theme of **Ignorance**.

## Further Reading/ Watching

"The fact it does not reference a specific war makes it a universal criticism of modern journalistic methods. The poem deals with a photographer's internal conflict- perhaps the guilt the persona feels at taking an image of a girl in a street in a war-zone. The girl in the image is carrying a baby, which she drops upon hearing a bomb go off- regardless of this disturbing scene, the image itself is used in a newspaper to demonstrate how the goodness of humanity still exists in a war zone."

# WHAT WERE THEY LIKE? KNOWLEDGE ORGANISER

## Context
*What Were They Like?* was written by Denise Levertov, and was published in 1971.

**Denise Levertov** – Priscilla Denise Levertov (1923-1997) was a highly-regarded American poet. Despite being born and raised in Ilford, England, many of her works deal specifically with American themes. Particularly in the 60s and 70s, Levertov delved into socio-political poetry – she founded the 'Writers and Artists Protest against the War in Vietnam' and took part in numerous rallies in order to raise awareness of these issues. She even spent some time in jail for civil disobedience.

**Vietnam War** – The Vietnam War, also known as the Second Indochina War, was a conflict that took place in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia between 1st November 1955 and 30th April 1975. It was officially fought between North Vietnam and the government of South Vietnam. North Vietnam was supported by the Soviet Union and other communist nations, whilst South Vietnam was aided by the United States and anti-communist allies. The war resulted in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia all becoming communist countries by 1975.

**The Viet Cong and American Mistrust** – The Viet Cong were a communist South Vietnamese group, funded by the north. They used guerilla warfare, disguising themselves in amongst the villagers and jungle terrain. Owing partly to the difficulties that US soldiers faced in establishing the enemy, many were hostile towards innocent citizens (some committed war crimes). The Air Force burnt forests to drive out the Viet Cong, destroying homes and injuring villagers.

**American Public Opinion** – Extensive military casualties and the involvement of US soldiers in war crimes created discord amongst Americans in relation to the war effort. Images such as that of 'Napalm Girl' (shown in the box above) circulated in the US media, and demonstrated the catastrophic effect that the drawn-out war was having on innocent Vietnamese people. As protests mounted, the US signed the Paris Peace Treaty and removed all forces from Vietnam. The North Vietnam then succeeded in defeating the south, in the 'Fall of Saigon.'

## Language/Structural Devices

**Interesting Verbs and Adjectives** – Levertov creates a vivid image of the placid and idyllic lives that the citizens of Vietnam lived before the war, through a range of interesting adjectives (peaceful, illuminated, light, pleasant) and verbs (reverence, singing, delight). These are then juxtaposed with wildly more violent imagery to describe their lives in the war, for example adjectives such as burned and bitter and verbs such as scream, charred and smashed. These vocabulary choices demonstrate how horrifically life changed for them.

**Quote:** *"When peaceful clouds were reflected in the paddies and the water buffalo stepped surely along terraces,"*

**Metaphors** – Figurative language is used sparingly, but to powerful effect. For example, the reference to the children as 'buds' in line 15. Such a comparison underlines the children's beauty and innocence, but also their potential to flower and flourish. This will now never happen, as there are 'no more buds', suggesting the children have been killed – hope has been eradicated in a place where there was once promise.

**Quote:** *"but after their children were killed there were no more buds."*

**Form/Structure** – The poem is structured unusually, with two distinct stanzas. The first stanza contains six questions, which are then answered in the longer second stanza. The simpler first verse may be seen to reflect the simple life lived before the war, whereas the more complex, device-filled second stanza shows the convolutions of wartime Vietnam.

**Quote:** *"Did the people of Viet Nam/ use lanterns of stone?"*

**Sound Imagery** – A number of different techniques are used to represent both the peaceful lives of the villagers and horrific sounds of war. For example, repetition of the soft 'l' sound in line 12 ("lanterns illuminated") underlines the villagers' tranquil lives, whilst the alliteration of the harsh 'b' sound in line 16 ("bitter to the burned mouth") echoes the dropping of bombs. Furthermore, onomatopoeic words such as 'smashed' and 'scream' allow the reader to hear the destruction and fear in the villages during wartime.

**Quote:** *"When bombs smashed those mirrors there was time only to scream."*

**Analogy** – Levertov compares the lives of the villagers before the war to natural events, demonstrating the harmony and simplicity with which they live. For example, their singing is compared to the 'flight of moths in moonlight', reflecting its humming, chant-like nature, and also demonstrating how serene and undisturbed their culture was. The villagers were at one with their surroundings.

**Quote:** *"It was reported that their singing resembled the flight of moths in moonlight."*

**Repetition** – Several words and phrases are repeated throughout the poem, in order to emphasise their importance. For example, throughout stanza 2, the term 'it is not remembered' is repeated, to highlight how aspects of the Vietnamese culture have been eroded from memory by the destructive, horrific events of the war.

**Quote:** *"It is not remembered. Remember."*

## Themes
**War** – The harsh realities of war are exposed through vivid imagery utilised at specific points in the poem, and in particular the experiences for everyday people. For example, Levertov details the bombs smashing the mirrors and the screams as people died. Through the inclusion of these details, Levertov emphasises the horrors of war.

**Culture** – Different aspects of Vietnamese culture are enquired about through the various questions and responses – literature, art, music, religion, language and technology. The repeated phrase in the second stanza 'it is not remembered' demonstrates that many aspects of Vietnamese culture have now been obliterated.

## The Poet's Thoughts

…of enduring importance is her relation, through poetry, to language. From early on she said that poetry is a means "to a saner state in the midst of our being." We get there through language carefully, thoughtfully and respectfully used. She said, paraphrasing the philosopher Martin Heidegger, that "to be human is to be a conversation," and that "any use of language is an action toward others." Little wonder that her words still speak so directly to us. Denise Levertov was fond of quoting the English Romantic poet William Wordsworth: "Language is not the dress but the incarnation of thought."
